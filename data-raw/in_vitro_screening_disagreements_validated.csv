Muscone exerts potent neuroprotective activities on cerebral ischemia. However, its underlying mechanism is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that pretreatment with muscone in PC12 cells markedly ameliorated the loss of cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Ca2+ overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cell apoptosis induced by glutamate. Furthermore, muscone also decreased NR1 (NMDA receptor subunit 1) protein expression, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression and prevented activitation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) and ASK1/JNK/p38 signaling pathways elicited by glutamate in PC12 cells. In conclusion, our results provided novel evidence that muscone protected PC12 cells against glutamate-induced apoptosis by attenuating ROS generation and Ca2+ influx, via NR1 and CaMKII-depended ASK-1/JNK/p38 signaling pathways. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanism by which ROS generation is regulated has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to explore the role of transforming growth factor-beta signaling in ROS generation. Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to I/R injury and PC-12 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA against activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)5 or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). The results indicated that I/R or H/R significantly increased ALK5 expression, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and NOX2/4 expression and activity, concomitant with ROS generation and apoptosis. In addition, ALK5 knockdown significantly reversed changes induced by H/R treatment in PC-12 cells. These results suggest that ALK5/SMAD2/3 signaling serves a key role in oxidative stress. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that ALK5/SMAD2/3 activation is associated with the regulation of NOX2/4 expression and exacerbates I/R injury.

Increasing glutamate leads to neurodegenerative disease. Nowadays, plant medicine plays a role in the treatment of some disorders. In this research, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of Ferula gummosa root extract against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma (PC12) and mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cell lines. The cells were pretreated with extract for 2 h and then exposed to glutamate for 24 h. After 24 h the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptotic cells were determined in both cell lines. Glutamate increased lipid peroxidation, ROS, and apoptotic cells in both cell lines. The extract significantly increased the cell viability and decreased the ROS generation under glutamate-induced oxidative stress in these cells. Also, the extract decreased the MDA level and apoptotic cells. The results showed that Ferula gummosa root may have a protective effect on glutamate- induced toxicity, suggesting that the extract protects neuronal cells from glutamate-induced oxidative stress.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

The present study was designed to explore whether botanical isoflavone puerarin could attenuate nitric oxide (NO)-mediated neurotoxicity via modulating the enzymes in the L-arginine-NO pathway. Neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is well known to induce neurodegeneration via a NO-dependent mechanism. We first validated that puerarin protected rat dopamingeric PC12 cells against 6-OHDA-induced neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner. We subsequently profiled the cellular responses to puerarin by a proteomic response fingerprinting approach. A total of 16 protein spots with >1.5-fold change of intensity were selected and identified by mass spectrometry. As one of puerarin-upregulated proteins, mitochondrial arginase-2 hydrolyzes L-arginine to L-ornithine, thereby competing with neuronal NOS for substrate L-arginine in mitochondria. Thus, we hypothesize that puerain may attenuate nitric oxide (NO)-mediated mitochondrial injury via increasing arginase-2 expression. Western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that puerarin increased arginase-2 expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Accordingly, puerarin suppressed 6-OHDA-induced NO production and neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and primary rat midbrain neurons. Arginase inhibitor BEC diminished the effect of puerarin on 6-OHDA-induced NO production and neurotoxicity. The activation of arginase-2 by puerarin represents an endogenous mechanism for specific control of NO-mediated mitochondrial damage. Thus, puerarin is a useful lead for suppressing NO-mediated neurotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases.

However, the exact pathophysiological mechanism underlying traumatic brain injury is complicated and the protective role of H2S is not yet fully known. Therefore, we combined the mechanical injury (scratch) with secondary injury including metabolic impairment (no glucose) together to investigate the underlying cellular mechanism of hydrogen sulfide in vitro models of traumatic brain injury. In the present study, we found that H2S could prevent the scratch-induced decrease in the expression of cystathionine-beta-synthetase, a key enzyme involved in the source of hydrogen sulfide, and endogenous hydrogen sulfide generation in PC12 cells. We also found that hydrogen sulfide could prevent scratch-induced cellular injury, alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species and cell death (autophagic cell death and apoptosis) in PC12 cells. It was also found that blocking PI3K/AKT pathway by LY294002, abolished the protection of H2S against scratch-induced cellular reactive oxygen species level and NRF2 accumulation and function in the nucleus. These results suggest that hydrogen sulfide protects against cell damage induced by scratch injury through modulation of the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. This study raises the possibility that hydrogen sulfide may have therapeutic efficacy in traumatic brain injury.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"
"0467a4bd-75f3-4f50-8a8c-071d968bcfff","Mild sustained and intermittent hypoxia induce apoptosis in PC-12 cells via different mechanisms","Episodic hypoxia, a characteristic feature of obstructive sleep apnea, induces cellular changes and apoptosis in brain regions associated with neurocognitive function. To investigate whether mild, intermittent hypoxia would induce more extensive neuronal damage than would a similar degree of sustained hypoxia, rat pheochromocytoma PC-12 neuronal cells were subjected to either sustained (5% O(2)) or intermittent (alternating 5% O(2) 35 min, 21% O(2) 25 min) hypoxia for 2 or 4 days. Quantitative assessment of apoptosis showed that while mild sustained hypoxia did not significantly increase cell apoptosis at 2 days (1.31 +/- 0.29-fold, n = 8; P = NS), a significant increase in apoptosis occurred after 4 days (2.25 +/- 0.4-fold, n = 8; P < 0.002), without increased caspase activation. Furthermore, caspase inhibition with the general caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK) did not modify sustained hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In contrast, mild, intermittent hypoxia induced significant increases in apoptosis at 2 days (3.72 +/- 1.43-fold, n = 8; P < 0.03) and at 4 days (4.57 +/- 0.82-fold, n = 8; P < 0.001) that was associated with enhanced caspase activity and attenuated by Z-VAD-FMK pretreatment. We conclude that intermittent hypoxia induces an earlier and more extensive apoptotic response than sustained hypoxia and that this response is at least partially dependent on caspase-mediated pathways. In contrast, caspases do not seem to play a role in sustained hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that different signaling pathways are involved in sustained and intermittent hypoxia-induced cell injury and may contribute to the understanding of differential brain susceptibility to sustained and intermittent hypoxia.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"
"04aa69a4-b635-4b61-b201-a82bc4d4c8df","Aminoindan and hydroxyaminoindan, metabolites of rasagiline and ladostigil, respectively, exert neuroprotective properties in vitro","The anti-Parkinson, selective irreversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor drug, rasagiline (Azilect), recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, has been shown to possess neuroprotective-neurorescue activities in in vitro and in vivo models. Recent preliminary studies indicated the potential neuroprotective effect of the major metabolite of rasagiline, 1-(R)-aminoindan. In the current study, the neuroprotective properties of 1-(R)-aminoindan were assessed employing a cytotoxic model of human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells in high-density culture-induced neuronal death. We show that aminoindan (0.1-1 mumol/L) significantly reduced the apoptosis-associated phosphorylated protein, H2A.X (Ser139), decreased the cleavage of caspase 9 and caspase 3, while increasing the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X, prevented the neuroprotection, indicating the involvement of PKC in aminoindan-induced cell survival. Aminoindan markedly elevated pPKC(pan) and specifically that of the pro-survival PKC isoform, PKCepsilon. Additionally, hydroxyaminoindan, a metabolite of a novel bifunctional drug, ladostigil [(N-propargyl-(3R) aminoindan-5yl)-ethyl methyl carbamate], combining cholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitor activity, exerted similar neuroprotective properties. Aminoindan and hydroxyaminoindan also protected rat pheochromacytoma PC-12 cells against the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine. Our findings suggest that both metabolites may contribute to the overall neuroprotective activity of their respective parent compounds, further implicating rasagiline and ladostigil as potentially valuable drugs for treatment of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders of aging. © 2007 The Authors.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

The primarily microglia cells are recognized as the brains resident macrophages and thought to remodel of the brain by removing presumably redundant, apoptotic neurons. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the anti-neuroinflammation effect of lychee seed fraction (LSF) in Abeta(1-42)-induced BV-2 cells and the underlying mechanism. The morphology results displayed that LSF could improve the status of Abeta(1-42)-induced BV-2 cells. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time PCR, and Western blotting results showed that LSF could significantly reduce the release, mRNA levels, and protein expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Abeta(1-42)-induced BV-2 cells, which were downregulated through suppressing the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Furthermore, LSF could upregulate Bcl-2 and downregulate Bax, Caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP protein expressions. Taken together, our results first demonstrated that LSF could suppress the inflammatory response via inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway, and inhibit apoptosis in Abeta(1-42)-induced BV-2 cells. Our findings further prove that LSF as a potential drug may be used for treating AD in the future.

Huprines, a group of potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), have shown a broad cholinergic pharmacological profile. Recently, it has been observed that huprine X (HX) improves cognition in non transgenic middle aged mice and shows a neuroprotective activity (increased synaptophysin expression) in 3xTg-AD mice. Consequently, in the present experiments the potential neuroprotective effect of huprines (HX, HY, HZ) has been analyzed in two different in vitro conditions: undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Cells were subjected to oxidative insult (H2O2, 200 muM) and the protective effects of HX, HY and HZ (0.01 muM-1 muM) were analyzed after a pre-incubation period of 24 and 48 hours. All huprines showed protective effects in both undifferentiated and NGF-differentiated cells, however only in differentiated cells the effect was dependent on cholinergic receptors as atropine (muscarinic antagonist, 0.1 muM) and mecamylamine (nicotinic antagonist, 100 muM) reverted the neuroprotection action of huprines. The decrease in SOD activity observed after oxidative insult was overcome in the presence of huprines and this effect was not mediated by muscarinic or nicotinic receptors. In conclusion, huprines displayed neuroprotective properties as previously observed in in vivo studies. In addition, these effects were mediated by cholinergic receptors only in differentiated cells. However, a non-cholinergic mechanism, probably through an increase in SOD activity, seems to be also involved in the neuroprotective effects of huprines. © 2013 Pera et al.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,5,"Excluded"
"08d8971e-4f32-4720-9c78-5e89ad4349f7","Potential neuroprotective effects of SIRT1 induced by glucose deprivation in PC12 cells","Nutrient availability is one of the most important signals regulating cellular fates including cell growth, differentiation, and death. Recent evidence suggests that the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) plays a prominent role in linking changes in nutritional availability with cellular fate regulation. SIRT1 expression is observed in neurons, yet the expressional and functional regulation of this protein is not fully understood. In the present study, we examined whether extracellular glucose concentration affects the expression and localization of SIRT1 in PC12 cells. Further, we examined levels of forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a), which is also controlled by changes in extracellular glucose concentration. We observed the total expression levels of SIRT1 and FoxO3a in PC12 cells were reduced when glucose availability increased via gene expressional control, at least in part. Nuclear localization of SIRT1 and FoxO3a was increased by glucose deprivation. Even though the changes in extracellular glucose concentration regulated SIRT1 and FoxO3a in a similar direction, the effects of nerve growth factor on these two proteins were completely different. Finally, we found the potent SIRT1 inhibitor enhanced glucose deprivation-induced cell death. Therefore, we propose that glucose deprivation-induced SIRT1 expression potentially plays a major role in protecting PC12 cells. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,5,"Excluded"

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of nAChR stimulation with nicotine on the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression and identify the molecular pathway involved in neuroprotection.Methods: We conducted miRNA expression profiling using a microarray to identify the miRNAs regulated by nicotine. miR-132-5p expression was validated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Cells were treated with nicotine, a miR-132-5p mimic or its inhibitor, and the cell viability was assessed. CREB, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and alpha-tubulin protein expression levels were determined by Western blotting analysis.Results: Using a rodent miRNA microarray, we identified 37 miRNAs regulated by nicotine. The microarray and RT-qPCR results showed 1.67-fold and 1.5-fold increases in miR-132-5p, respectively, upon nicotine treatment. Immunoblotting revealed a >2-fold increase in phosphorylation of CREB with nicotine, peaking at 4 h. Nicotine treatment of cells increased viability from 35% to 54%, and Bcl-2 immunoreactivity increased by 1.4-fold. Overexpression of miR-132-5p increased cell viability from 38% to 70% and increased Bcl-2 expression by 3.9-fold. Inhibition of miR-132-5p decreased cell viability to 25%, whereas no change was observed in Bcl-2. Bax expression remained unchanged following treatment with a miR-132-5p mimic or its inhibitor.Discussion: Our results suggest that nAChR activation facilitates cell survival by upregulating miR-132-5p, which upregulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results present miR-132-5p as a potential novel therapeutic target to achieve neuroprotection via stimulation of nAChRs.Abbreviations: CCK-8: Cell counting kit-8; nAChR: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; NGF: Nerve growth factor; WST-8: [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt].","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

However, the role of PHD inhibitor (PHDI) in the recovery of spinal cord injury remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the protective role of a novel PHDI FG-4592 both in vivo and in vitro. FG-4592 treatment stabilized HIF1alpha expression both in PC12 cells and in spinal cord. FG-4592 treatment significantly inhibited tert-Butyl hydroperoxide(TBHP)-induced apoptosis and increases the survival of neuronal PC-12 cells. FG-4592 administration also improved recovery and increased the survival of neurons in spinal cord lesions in the mice model. Combination therapy including the specific HIF-1alpha blocker YC-1 down-regulated the HIF-1alpha expression and partially abolished the protective effect of FG-4592. Taken together, our results revealed that the role of FG-4592 in SCI recovery is related to the stabilization of HIF-1alpha and inhibition of apoptosis. Overall, our study suggests that PHDIs may be feasible candidates for therapeutic intervention after SCI and central nervous system disorders in humans. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"0b8cbccf-f5dd-4531-921b-5000b74328b1","Role of glutathione metabolism in the glutamate-induced-programmed cell death of neuronal-like PC12 cells","In addition to its well-known interaction with ionotropic and metabotropic receptors, glutamate may, at high concentrations, interfere with a cystine-glutamate antiport designated as X, and lead to a significant decrease in cystine uptake and intracellular glutathione level. These effects, in turn, may induce death in various cellular bodies including astrocytes, rat glioma cells and cortical neurons in culture. In the present paper we demonstrate that the toxicity evoked by glutamate in a neuronal-like model is indeed related to the metabolism of glutathione since glutamate toxicity is preceded by a significant depletion of intracellular glutathione and is abolished in the presence of precursors of glutathione synthesis such as cystine and N-acetylcysteine. It also appears that prolonged incubation in cystine-free medium leads to cell detachment and death, a phenomenon which is progressively abolished in the presence of increasing concentrations of cystine. In addition, buthionine sulfoximine, a known inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, also induces cell lysis with a time-course very similar to that of glutamate. However, depletion of glutathione is probably not sufficient to trigger the death signal since cycloheximide, which inhibits the toxic effect of both glutamate and buthionine sulfoximine, does not block the decrease in cellular glutathione content induced by these drugs. Our results therefore confirm that oxidative stress and intracellular glutathione depletion are able to trigger programmed cell death in neuronal-like cells, although the exact nature of the death mechanisms remains largely unknown.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

An imbalance in mitochondrial fission and fusion is one of the most important structural abnormalities found in a large number of mitochondrial dysfunction related diseases. Here, we investigated the effects of mitochondrial division inhibitor A (mdivi A) and mdivi B, two small molecule inhibitors of mitochondrial fission protein dunamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1), in neuronal injury induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells. We found that mdivi A and mdivi B inhibited OGD-induced neuronal injury through attenuating apoptotic cell death. These two inhibitors also preserved mitochondrial function, as evidenced by reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cytochrome c release, as well as prevented loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, mdivi A and mdivi B significantly suppressed mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, but had no effect on cytoplasmic Ca2+ after OGD injury. The results of calcium imaging and immunofluorescence staining showed that Drp-1 inhibitors attenuated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release and prevented ER morphological changes induced by OGD. These results demonstrate that Drp-1 inhibitors protect against ischemic neuronal injury through inhibiting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake from the ER store and attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",5,72,"Included"

The present study was designed to examine the cognition-enhanced, anti-cholinesterase, and neuroprotective effects of BZYX. In the passive avoidance performance and radial arm maze, BZYX showed a comparable effect to donepezil and rivastigmine on memory deficits in different stages induced by scopolamine, NaNO2 and ethanol, respectively. Ellmans assay indicated BZYX exhibited high inhibition on AChE activity. IC50 values for BZYX: 0.058 +/- 0.022 muM; donepezil: 0.019 +/- 0.004 muM; rivastigmine: 3.81 +/- 2.81 muM; glantamine: 3.01 +/- 1.85 muM and huperzine A: 0.053 +/- 0.016 muM. BZYX also presented great neuroprotecive function from apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide(H2O2) in PC12 cells. MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection showed the viability of PC12 cells remarkably decreased with 400 muM H2O2, while it significantly increased when the cells were pretreated with 0.1-1.0 muM BZYX. BZYX pretreatment remarkably reversed the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (DELTAPSIm), scavenged reactive oxygen species formation induced by H2O2 and resulted in up-regulation of procaspase3 and xIAP protein level and down-regulation of phosphorylated JNK protein, p53 protein level and cleavage of caspase 3. It is speculated that the mitochondrial pathway, mediated by Bcl-2 family and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs), might involved in the neuroprotection of BZYX. These results first demonstrated that BZYX had neuroprotective effects as well as cognition enhancement and acetylcholinesterase inhibition.

Mammalian Ngb is involved in neuroprotection under oxidative stress conditions, such as ischemia and reperfusion. We previously demonstrated that human ferric Ngb binds to the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (Galphai) and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Galphai. Recently, we used a protein delivery reagent, Chariot, and demonstrated that the GDI activity of human Ngb is tightly correlated with its neuroprotective activity. In the present study, we found that chimeric ZHHH Ngb, in which module M1 of human Ngb is replaced by that of zebrafish Ngb, protects PC12 cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death even in the absence of Chariot. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Ngb proteins, we demonstrated that both zebrafish and chimeric ZHHH Ngb can penetrate cell membranes in the absence of Chariot, suggesting that module M1 of zebrafish Ngb can translocate into cells.

Ginkgolides A, B and C are the main components of DGMI. This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DGMI components against ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro. Acute cerebral ischemic injury was induced in rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 1.5 h followed by 24 h reperfusion. The rats were treated with DGMI (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, iv) at the onset of reperfusion and 12 h after reperfusion. Administration of DGMI significantly decreased rat neurological deficit scores, reduced brain infarct volume, and induced protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation, which prompted the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and phosphorylation of the survival regulatory protein cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). Nrf2 activation led to expression of the downstream protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). In addition, PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in vitro, treatment with DGMI (1, 10 and 20 mug/mL) or ginkgolides A, B or C (10 mumol/L for each) significantly reduced PC12 cell death and increased phosphorylation of Akt, nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and activation of CREB. Activation of Nrf2 and CREB could be reversed by co-treatment with a phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. These observations suggest that ginkgolides act as novel extrinsic regulators activating both Akt/Nrf2 and Akt/CREB signaling pathways, protecting against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in vivo and in vitro.

Crocin, one of the water-soluble carotenoids isolated from the Crocus sativus L (saffron) stigma, has been reported to exert therapeutic potential in many disease models. Here, we establish an in vitro PD model using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-injured PC12 cells to investigate the protective effects of crocin. Crocin treatment significantly attenuated MPP+-induced cell injury and apoptosis with little toxicity, and these protective effects were still observed even if crocin treatment was delayed to 6 h after injury. Crocin also inhibited MPP+-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP synthesis, which correlates with suppressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through inhibiting ER chaperone and ER related apoptotic factors. In addition, ER calcium release and morphological changes in ER lumen after MPP+ exposure were all partially prevented by crocin. By using specific targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knockdown the expression of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), we found that crocin-induced protection and inhibition of ER stress was mediated by inverting MPP+-induced decrease of Wnt through the CHOP pathway. Our study demonstrates a pivotal role of ER stress in mediating PD related neuronal injury via the regulation of CHOP-Wnt pathway, and suggests the therapeutic values of crocin against ER stress-associated cytotoxicity.

Sch B (10 muM) markedly inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas LY294002 (20 muM), a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitor, blocked the antiapoptotic effect. More importantly, Sch B (10 muM) increased the phosphoprotein kinase B/protein kinase B (Akt) and B-cell lymphoma-2/Bcl-2 associated X protein ratios on preincubation with cells for 2 h, which was then inhibited by LY294002 (20 muM). Results indicate that Sch B can protect PC12 cells from apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway and may emerge as a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases.

Cerebral ischemia induced autophagy aggravates inflammation and neural injury. However, the effect of autophagy in the modulation of microglial phenotype is still unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagic flux in the alternation of microglial phenotype following oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in BV-2 cells. Inhibition of autophagic flux by NH4Cl exposure significantly increased the level of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II and p62 in control and OGD/R (12 h, 24 h and 48 h) groups, but did not change their expression in OGD/R 72 h group, indicating that autophagic flux was inhibited at OGD/R 72 h. Once autophagic flux was inhibited at OGD/R 72 h or at OGD/R 24 h (with NH4Cl), BV-2 cells mainly showed M1 phenotype with increased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and decreased M2 markers including interleukin-10 (IL-10), Arginase 1 (Arg-1), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Further study indicated that inhibition of autophagic flux activated NF-kappaB pathway and decreased the activity of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which contributed to the alternation of microglial phenotype. Therefore, inhibition of autophagic flux regulated the alternation of microglial phenotype by modulating the balance between NF-kappaB and CREB.

Recent studies suggest that changes in microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) may affect the development of the stroke. However, few studies have investigated the role of miRNAs in behavioral disorder in early stroke. In the present study, animal models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) are used, as well as a cell model of neurite outgrowth to further investigate the role of miRNAs in targeting synapse-associated proteins expression in early stroke. The authors used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from the cortex tissue samples from the rats of MCAO and control rats. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to verify the candidate miRNAs discovered by microarray analysis. Data indicated that miR-125a was significantly increased in the cortex of the model of MCAO, which were concomitant with that rats of MCAO at the same age displayed significant behavioral deficits. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the cell adhesion molecule 2 (Cadm2, mRNA) neurite outgrowth-associated protein is targeted by miR-125a. Overexpression of miR-125a reduced the level of Cadm2 expression in PC12 cell injury induced by free-serum. In contrast, inhibition of miR-125a using miR-125a inhibitors significantly resulted in higher levels of Cadm2 expression. In conclusion, miR-125a is involved in the behavioral disorder of animal models of MCAO by regulation of Cadm2. Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

These cells have been used previously to mimic some of the properties of in vivo brain ischemia-reperfusion-injury (IRI) and have been instrumental in identifying common mechanisms such as calcium overload, redox potential, lipid peroxidation and MAPKs modulation. In addition, they were useful for establishing the role of certain membrane penetrable cocktails of antioxidants as well as potential growth factors which may act in neuroprotection. Pharmacological mechanisms of neuroprotection addressing modulation of the MAPK cascade and increased redox potential by natural products, drugs and growth factors secreted by stem cells, in either undifferentiated or nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells exposed to ischemic conditions are discussed for future prospects in neuroprotection studies.

This signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders, including ischemic brain injury. In this study, we have cloned a novel rat gene product, designated as Apaf-1-interacting protein (AIP), which functions as a dominant-negative inhibitor of the Apaf-1-caspase-9 pathway. AIP is constitutively expressed in the brain, but at substantially lower levels than Apaf-1 and caspase-9. AIP can directly bind to Apaf-1 in vitro through its N-terminal caspase-recruiting domain, and this protein interaction was increased in cells undergoing apoptosis. Cytosolic extracts from cells overexpressing AIP were highly resistant to cytochrome c-dATP-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Gene transfection of AIP into cell lines, including the neuronal-differentiated PC12 cells, potently suppressed apoptosis induced by various pro-apoptotic stimuli. To further investigate the functional role of AIP in primary neurons and in the brain, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying the AIP cDNA was constructed. AAV-mediated overexpression of AIP in primary cortical-hippocampal neurons markedly reduced cell death and caspase-3 activation triggered by protein kinase C inhibition, DNA damage, or oxygen-glucose deprivation. Moreover, intracerebral infusion of the AAV vector resulted in robust AIP expression in the hippocampus and significantly promoted CA1 neuronal survival after transient global cerebral ischemia. These results suggest that molecular targeting of the Apaf-1-caspase-9 signaling pathway may be a feasible neuroprotective strategy to enhance the endogenous threshold for caspase activation and prevent neuronal loss in stroke and related disorders.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",1,14,"Excluded"

The specific aim of this paper was to evaluate the potential role of HIF-1alpha in purine-mediated neuroprotection. We show that adenosine and inosine efficiently rescued clonal rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (up to 43.6%) as well as primary cerebellar granule neurons (up to 25.1%) from hypoxic insult, and furthermore, that HIF-1alpha is critical for purine-mediated neuroprotection. Next, we studied hypoxia or purine nucleoside increased nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha in PC12 cells. As a possible result of increased protein stabilization or synthesis an up to 2.5-fold induction of HIF-1alpha accumulation was detected. In cerebellar granule neurons, purine nucleosides induced an up to 3.1-fold HIF-1alpha accumulation in cell lysates. Concomitant with these results, small interfering RNA-mediated reduction of HIF-1alpha completely abolished adenosine- and inosine-mediated protection in PC12 cells and severely hampered purine nucleoside-mediated protection in primary neurons (up to 94.2%). Data presented in this paper thus clearly demonstrate that HIF-1alpha is a key regulator of purine nucleoside-mediated rescue of hypoxic neuronal cells. © 2008 The Authors.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,5,"Excluded"

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Hormesis is an adaptive mechanism generally activated by mild oxidative stress to protect the cells from further damage. Many phytochemicals have been shown to induce hormesis. This study aims to investigate whether the neuroprotective activity of BBR is mediated by hormesis and the related signaling pathways in 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells and zebrafish neurotoxic models. Our results demonstrated that BBR induced a typical hormetic response in PC12 cells, i.e. low dose BBR significantly increased the cell viability, while high dose BBR inhibited the cell viability. Moreover, low dose BBR protected the PC12 cells from 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, whereas relatively high dose BBR did not show neuroprotective activity. The hormetic and neuroprotective effects of BBR were confirmed to be mediated by up-regulated PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 cell survival and Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidative signaling pathways. In addition, low dose BBR markedly mitigated the 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss and behavior movement deficiency in zebrafish, while high dose BBR only slightly exhibited neuroprotective activities. These results strongly suggested that the neuroprotection of BBR were attributable to the hormetic mechanisms via activating cell survival and antioxidative signaling pathways.

The neuropathy is characterized by degeneration of sensory axons that may be severe enough to be dose limiting. Axonal degeneration involves the activation of the calcium-activated proteases calpains, and here we tested whether systemic inhibition of calpains with the peptide alpha-ketoamide calpain inhibitor AK295 can reduce the clinical and pathological effects of Taxol in a rodent model of Taxol neuropathy. In mice with Taxol neuropathy, AK295 reduced the degree of axonal degeneration in sensory nerve roots, and improved clinical measures of neuropathy, including behavioural and electrophysiological function. These findings were consistent for both 3- and 6-week models of neuropathy. In vitro, Taxol caused activation of both calpains and caspases in PC12 cells. AK295 inhibited the activation of calpains but did not interfere with the antimitotic effects of Taxol on microtubules, nor did it inhibit caspase-mediated cell death. These data implicate calpains in the pathogenesis of Taxol neuropathy, and demonstrate that AK295 can prevent axonal degeneration and clinical neuropathy in mice. In addition, AK295 did not interfere with the primary antineoplastic effects of Taxol on microtubules and cell death, suggesting that systemic calpain inhibition may be a good strategy for preventing neuropathy in patients being treated with Taxol.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) showed that isoflavonoid compounds of kudzu root (Pueraria lobata) fermented by Eurtotium cristatum and extracted using de-ionized water were higher active compared with non-fermented. A model of H2O2-inducd cell damage was built using rat pheochromocytoma line 12 (PC12) cell to observe the protective effect of non-fermented kudzu root (Pueraria lobata) (NFK) and fermented kudzu root (Pueraria lobata) (FK). Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed through inverted microscopy and flow cytometry. The level of lactate dehydrogenase, catalase activity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated. Results showed that NFK and FK could significantly protect PC12 cell against damage caused by H2O2-induced oxidative stress. The intracellular antioxidant system was increased, protected the cell membrane inhibit H2O2-induced apoptosis by scavenging of ROS. Moreover, NFK and FK regulated the cell cycle to prevent cell apoptosis.

In this study, we examined the effect of citicoline on lead-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. The PC12 cells were pre-treated with citicoline and then exposed to lead for 48 h. The effect of citicoline on cell survival was examined by MTT assay. In addition, levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), total thiol groups, total antioxidant power (TAP), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) were evaluated. The levels of Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 were also measured, by Western blot analysis. Citicoline significantly increased the cell viability of PC12 cells exposed to lead. Treatment of PC12 cells with lead increased LPO levels, and citicoline effectively decreased LPO. Levels of total thiol groups and TAP, CAT, SOD, and GSH were significantly increased in citicoline-treated PC12 cells compared with the lead-treated group. Citicoline pretreatment significantly reduced Bax expression, and increased the level of Bcl-2 expression. Citicoline also reduced caspase-3 activation in PC12 cells compared with the lead-treated group. Our findings indicate that citicoline exerts a neuroprotective effect against lead-induced injury in PC12 cells through mitigation of oxidative stress and, at least in part, through suppression of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019, Canadian Science Publishing.

The PC12 cells were exposed to H2O2 (400 mumol.L-1) for 1 h in the presence or absence of SMXZF pre-treatment for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The efflux of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the intracellular content of malondialdehyde (MDA), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and caspase-3 were also determined. Cell apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining method. The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, Akt, and MAPKs were detected by Western blotting analyses. SMXZF pretreatment significantly increased the cell viability and SOD activity and improved the cell morphological changes, while reduced the levels of LDH and MDA at the concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mug.mL-1. SMXZF also inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Moreover, SMXZF reduced the activity of caspase-3, up-regulated the protein ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax and inhibited the expression of cleaved caspase-3, p-Akt, p-p38, p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 in H2O2-induced PC12 cells. Co-incubation of Akt inhibitor or p38 inhibitor partly attenuated the protection of SMXZF against H2O2-injured PC12 cells. In conclusion, our findings suggested that SMXZF attenuated H2O2-induced injury in PC12 cells by inhibiting Akt and MAPKs signaling pathways, which might shed insights on its neuroprotective mechanism.

The mechanisms of hypoglycemia-induced neural death and apoptosis are not clear and reperfusion injury may be involved. Recent studies show that glucose deprivation/reperfusion induced more neuronal cell death than glucose deprivation itself. The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are implicated in the regulation of cell apoptosis and survival, but their role in neuronal cells remains unclear. We examined the role of FOXO transcription factors and the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and apoptosis-related signaling pathways in PC-12 cells exposed to repeated glucose deprivation/reperfusion. Method(s): PC-12 cells were exposed to control (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM] containing 25 mM glucose) or glucose deprivation/reperfusion (DMEM with 0 mM glucose for 6 hours and then DMEM with 25 mM glucose for 18 hours) for 5 days. MTT assay and Western blot analysis were performed for cell viability, apoptosis, and the expression of survival signaling pathways. FOXO3/4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was done to ascertain the involvement of FOXO transcription factors in glucose deprivation/reperfusion conditions. Result(s): Compared to PC-12 cells not exposed to hypoglycemia, cells exposed to glucose deprivation/reperfusion showed a reduction of cell viability, decreased expression of phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-2, and an increase of cleaved caspase-3 expression. Of note, FOXO3 protein was localized in the nuclei of glucose deprivation/reperfusion cells but not in the control cells. Conclusion(s): Repeated glucose deprivation/reperfusion caused the neuronal cell death.

Antioxidin-RL peptide is a free radical scavenger found in the skin of plateau frog Odorrana livida, which is more stable than vitamin C as it resists light-induced degradation. However, whether and how antioxidin-RL protects cells from oxidative stress was not clear. Here we addressed this issue, and in addition, we designed a series of antioxidin cognates by adding tyrosine residues to enhance free radical-binding capability. We performed free radical-clearing assays in solution to screen the mutants, and found a mutant antioxidin-2 that was as stable as antioxidin-RL and cleared free radical faster. By using PC-12 cells as a model, we demonstrated that both antioxidin-2 and antioxidin-RL inhibited the accumulation of intracellular free radicals triggered by H2O2, reduced mitochondria membrane potential dissipation, maintained mitochondrial morphology, and decreased the expression of dynamin-related protein-1 in mitochondria, with antioxidin-RL more effective. Antioxidin-RL also attenuated the changes in SOD1 and GPx1 expression induced by H2O2. These findings provide insight into the anti-oxidative mechanisms of antioxidin-RL and its derivatives, which will provide rational basis for the development of more effective antioxidants to cure diseases.

A recombinant human erythropoietin variant with low glycosylation and without hematopoietic effect (EpoL) was purified from skimmed goat milk. Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) was obtained from CHO cell line and used as control to compare EpoL effects. Neuroprotection studies were performed in PC12 cells and rat hippocampal slices. Cells were pretreated during 1 h with EpoL or Epo and exposed to oxidative agents (H2O2 or FCCP); cell viability was assayed at the end of the experiment by the MTT method. Hippocampal slices were exposed to 15 min of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and the neuroprotective drugs EpoL or Epo were incubated for 2 h post-OGD in re-oxygenated medium. Cell cultures stressed with oxidative agents, and pretreated with EpoL, showed neuroprotective effects of 30% at a concentration 10 times lower than that of Epo. Moreover, similar differences were observed in OGD ex vivo assays. Neuroprotection elicited by EpoL was lost when an antibody against EpoR was present, indicating that its effect is EpoR-dependent. In conclusion, our results suggest that EpoL has a more potent neuroprotective profile than Epo against oxidative stress, mediated by activation of EpoR, thus EpoL represents an important target to develop a potential biopharmaceutical to treat different central nervous system pathologies related to oxidative stress such as stroke or neurodegenerative diseases.

In this report, we show that the volume-activated chloride channels play a key role in hydrogen peroxide (H2O 2) preconditioning-induced cell protection in pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. The preconditioning with 100 muM H2O2 for 90 min protected the cells from injury induced by long period exposure to 300 muM H2O2. The protective effect was attenuated by pretreatment with the chloride channel blockers, 5-nitro-2-3-phenylpropylamino benzoic acid (NPPB) and tamoxifen. H2O2 preconditioning directly activated a chloride current, which was moderately outward-rectified and sensitive to the chloride channel blockers and hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage. H2O2 preconditioning functionally up-regulated the activities of volume-activated chloride channels and enhanced the regulatory volume decrease when exposure to extracellular hypotonic challenges. In addition, acute application of H2O2 showed distinctive actions on cell volume and membrane permeability in H2O2 preconditioned cells. In H2O2 preconditioned cells, acute application of 300 muM H2O2 first promptly induced a decrease of cell volume and enhancement of cell membrane permeability, and then, cell volume was maintained at a relatively stable level and the facilitation of membrane permeability was reduced. Conversely, in control cells, 300 muM H2O2 induced a slow but persistent apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) and facilitation of membrane permeability. H2O 2 preconditioning also significantly up-regulated the expression of ClC-3 protein, the molecular candidate of the volume-activated chloride channel. These results suggest that H2O2 preconditioning can enhance the expression and functional activities of volume-activated chloride channels, thereby modulate cell volume and cell membrane permeability, which may contribute to neuroprotection against oxidant-induced injury. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Along the second part of the review, we describe how different classes of drugs have been evaluated in chromaffin cells to determine their neuroprotective profile in different neurodegenerative-related models.

Mulberry fruit extracts (ME) have demonstrated the antioxidant activity and neuroprotection. The study was to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of ME against beta-amyloid 25-35- (Abeta 25-35-) induced PC12 cells injury. Cells preincubated with or without ME (200 mug/mL) for 24 h were treated with Abeta 25-35 (20 mumol/L) for another 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT, gene expression profiles were examined by cDNA microarrays, and RT-PCR were used to confirm the results of microarray assays. ME pretreatment was found to neutralize the cytotoxicity and prevent Abeta 25-35-induced cells injury. Analyses of gene expression profile revealed that genes involving cell adhesion, peptidase activity, cytokine activity, ion binding activity, and angiogenesis regulation were significantly modulated by ME pretreatment. Among those genes, Apaf1, Bace2, and Plcb4 were enriched in the []Alzheimers disease-reference pathway[] and downregulated after ME intervention. RT-PCR results showed that ME preincubation could significantly inhibit Abeta 25-35 increased mRNA levels of these three genes. Overall, ME pretreatment could substantially alleviate PC12 cells injury and downregulate expression of AD-related genes, such as Apaf1, Bace2, and Plcb4. This study has a great nutrigenomics interest and brings new and important light in the field of AD intervention.

Since MK-801, an antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, showed many adverse reactions that hampered its clinical applications, development of safe and effective agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia is eagerly required. This study was to investigate the effects of N1-(quinolin-2-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine (QMA), a polyamine analogue, on the in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemic damage. The results revealed that pretreatment with QMA could attenuate Glu, putrescine (Put) and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death, lipid peroxidation as well as the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and intracellular [Ca2+]i in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. The results also demonstrated that QMA could inhibit NMDA-mediated intracellular [Ca2+]i accumulation in rat primary cortical neurons and reduce brain infarct volume in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. The present report suggested that polyamines played a crucial role in the pathological processes of cerebral ischemic damage and that QMA or other novel polyamine analogues could be promising therapeutic candidates for stroke by virtue of their anti-hypoxia and antioxidation property. © 2012 ISDN.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",2,30,"Included"
"2f43683d-5e4b-406c-ba96-1707472ea527","Molecular basis of neuroprotective activities of rasagiline and the anti-Alzheimer drug TV3326 [(N-propargyl-(3R)aminoindan-5-YL)-ethyl methyl carbamate]","Rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-(R)-aminoindan) is a selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) inhibitor which has been developed as an anti-Parkinson drug. In controlled monotherapy and as adjunct to L-dopa it has shown anti-Parkinson activity. In cell culture (PC-12 and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells) it exhibits neuroprotective and antiapoptotic activity against several neurotoxins (SIN-1, MPTP, 6-hydroxydopamine and N-methyl-(R)-salsolinol) and ischemia. In vivo, it reduces the sequelae of traumatic brain injury in mice and speeds their recovery. The neuroprotective activity of rasagaline does not result from MAO B inhibition, since its S-enantiomer, TVP1022, which has 1000-fold weaker MAO inhibitory activity, exhibits similar neuroprotective properties. Introduction of a carbamate moiety into the rasagiline molecule to confer cholinesterase inhibitory activity for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, resulted in compounds TV3326 [(N-Propargyl-(3R)Aminoindan-5-YL)-Ethyl Methyl Carbamate] and its S-enantiomer TV3279 [(N-Propargyl-(3S)Aminoindan-5-YL)-Ethyl Methyl Carbamate], which retain the neuroprotective activities of rasagiline and TVP1022. They also antagonize scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial memory. In addition, TV3326 exhibits brain-selective MAO A and B inhibitory activity after chronic administration and has antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test. This is associated with an increase in brain levels of serotonin. The antiapoptotic activity of these propargylamine-containing derivatives may be related to their ability to delay the opening of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), which are part of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The propargylamine moiety is responsible for the increase in the mitochondrial family of Bcl-2 proteins, prevention in the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential, prevention of the activation of caspase 3, and of translocation of glycerlaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The latter processes are closely associated with neurotoxin-induced apoptosis. Rasagiline interacts with and prevents the binding of PK11195 to the pro-apoptotic peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, which together with Bcl-2, hexokinase, porin, and adenine nucleotide translocator constitutes part of the VDAC. Furthermore, rasagiline, TV3326 and TV3279 are able to influence the processing of amyloid precursor protein by activation of alpha-secretase and increasing the release of soluble alpha APP in rat PC-12 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in rat and mice cortex and hippocampus. This process has been shown to involve the upregulation of PKC and MAP kinase. It is quite likely that the induction of Bcl-2 and activation of PKC by rasagiline and TV3326 is closely linked to the anti-apototic action of these drugs and their ability to process APP by activation of alpha-secretase.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,7,"Excluded"

Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid broadly present in different medicinal herbs, has been reported to have neuroprotective effect. In the present study, the effects of berberine against glutamate-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis were investigated. Materials and Methods: The cultured PC12 and N2a cells were pretreated (2 hr) with varying concentrations of berberine (50-1000 muM), followed by exposure to glutamate (10 mM) for 24 hr. The cells viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, DNA fragmentation and the expressions of pro-apoptotic (cleaved caspase-3 and bax) and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) proteins were then measured. Results: In both cell lines, pretreatment with berberine (especially at low concentrations) significantly decreased ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation, while improving glutathione content and SOD activity in glutamate-injured cells. Moreover, berberine showed anti-apoptotic effects by reducing the glutamate-evoked caspase-3 and bax/bcl-2 overexpression. Conclusion: The results of present study suggest that berberine protects against glutamate-induced PC12 and N2a cells injury by decreasing oxidative stress and subsequently inhibiting apoptosis. This is relevant to berberine treatment in neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia (Alzheimers disease), seizures, and stroke. Copyright © 2017, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

It is estimated diabetic population will increase to 592 million by the year 2035. This is while at least 50-60% of all diabetic patients will suffer from neuropathy in their lifetime. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation are crucial pathways in development and progression of DN. Since there is also no selective and effective therapeutic agent to prevent or treat high glucose (HG)-induced neuronal cell injury, it is crucial to explore tools by which one can reduce factors related to these pathways. Phosphodiesterase 4 and 7 (PDE 4 and 7) regulate oxidative damage, neurodegenaration, and inflammatory responses through modulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level, and thus can be as important drug targets for regulating DN. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of inhibitors of PDE 4 and 7, named rolipram and BRL5048, on HG-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells as an in vitro cellular model for DN and determine the possible mechanisms for theirs effects. We report that the PC12 cells pre-treatment with rolipram (2 muM) and/or BRL5048 (0.2 muM) for 60 min and then exposing the cells to HG (4.5 g/L for 72 h) or normal glucose (NG) (1 g/L for 72 h) condition show: (1) significant attenuation in ROS, MDA and TNF-a levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, expression of caspase 3 and UCP2 proteins; (2) significant increase in viability, GSH/GSSG ratio, MMP and ATP levels. All these data together led us to propose PDE 4 and 7 inhibitors, and specifically, rolipram and BRL5048, as potential drugs candidate to be further studied for the prevention and treatment of DN.

While hypothermia down-regulates global protein synthesis and cell metabolism, low temperature induces a small subset of proteins that includes the RNA-binding protein RBM3 (RNA-binding motif protein 3), which has recently been implicated in cell survival. Here, immunohistochemistry of the developing postnatal murine brain revealed a spatio-temporal neuronal RBM3 expression pattern very similar to that of doublecortin, a marker of neuronal precursor cells. Mild hypothermia (32degreeC) profoundly promoted RBM3 expression and rescued neuronal cells from forced apoptosis as studied in primary neurons, PC12 cells, and cortical organotypic slice cultures. Blocking RBM3 expression in neuronal cells by specific siRNAs significantly diminished the neuroprotective effect of hypothermia while vector-driven RBM3 over-expression reduced cleavage of PARP, prevented internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and LDH release also in the absence of hypothermia. Together, neuronal RBM3 up-regulation in response to hypothermia apparently accounts for a substantial proportion of hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Immunoregulation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is more efficient at restoring biologic function of injured tissue than transdifferentiation during transplantation. However, the exact mechanisms and characteristics of MSC regarding immunomodulation are still unknown, especially in the damaged niche after hypoxicischemic insult. We investigated the anti-apoptotic actions of MSC against the neurotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Methods. To mimic hypoxicischemic brain injury in vivo, a relatively high H2O2 concentration and short period were used to treat PC12 cells. MSC were co-cultured directly with the injured PC12 cells, and 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4,5-dimethylthiazoly)-3-(4-sulfophenyl) tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) and nitric oxide (NO) assays, intracellular Ca2 and resting membrane potential (RMP) were analyzed. Apoptotic-associated genes and cytokine releases were detected by reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. After exposure to H2O2, the viability of PC12 cells was significantly decreased, while the levels of LDH and NO increased, resulting in intracellular Ca2 accumulation and cell apoptosis. Co-culture of MSC with the H2O2-treated PC12 cells sustained viability of the PC12 cells, reduced LDH levels and NO release, and improved Ca2 influx and cell apoptosis. The injured PC12 cells exhibited lower RMP following co-culture with MSC compared with the injured PC12 cells alone. The mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 were up-regulated and caspase-3 levels down-regulated in the MSC co-culture groups. The release of interleukin (IL)-10 was gradually reduced by co-cultured MSC, while the release of IL-6 was sharply increased following MSC co-culture. Conclusions. These findings indicate that MSC have neuroprotective effects on suppressing cell apoptosis via regulation of the H2O2-impaired microenvironment, partly through IL-6 and IL-10 cytokine production. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

Nerve growth factor (NGF) plays a pivotal role in regeneration and reestablishment of neuronal function via activating PI3K/Akt survival signaling pathways. Curcumin owns neuroprotective effect following brain injury. In the present study, we attempt to investigate underlying mechanism of neuroprotective effect of curcumin through elucidating its correlation with NGF and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): PC-12 cells were exposed H2O2 in order to induce neuron cell injury and cells were then treated with curcumin. Caspase-3, NGF level and Akt phosphorylation were determined using flow cytometry and western blotting. Then, cells were treated with NGF specific siRNA followed by measurement of apoptosis, NGF and Akt phosphorylation levels. In animal model, rats were subjected to SNI and then randomly designated into four different groups: curcumin, curcumin + LY294002, curcumin + NGF shRNA, and negative controls and 12 rats in each group (n = 12). After four weeks of continuous treatment, tissue samples were obtained and subjected to TUNEL, NeuN double staining and western blotting. Result(s): Curcumin significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells induced by H2O2 and this effect was associated with upregulation of TrkA, Akt and downregulation of p17. ProNGF level was significantly decreased while mature NGF level was increased with curcumin treatment. When NGF was suppressed, anti-apoptotic effect of curcumin was attenuated. In addition, inhibition of PI3K/Akt results in increased apoptotic rate compared to vehicles following curcumin treatment which was reflected by decreased p17, Ki67, and cyclin D1. Suppression of NGF and inhibition of PI3K led to increased neuron cell death through increasing proNGF and decreasing mNGF, Akt, TrkA, p75NTR, and p17. Conclusion(s): Our findings revealed that curcumin exerts its protective effect against injured neurons through stimulating NGF release which further activates TrkA and PI3K/Akt cell survival signaling.

These effects of GM1 were abolished by Trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and diminished by MEK1/2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase C inhibitors. Hydrogen peroxide activates Trk tyrosine kinase; Akt and ERK1/2 are activated downstream of this protein kinase. GM1 was found to activate Trk receptor tyrosine kinase in PC12 cells. GM1 (100 nM and 10 micro M) increased the basal activity of Akt, but did not change Akt activity in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide. Basal ERK1/2 activity in PC12 cells was increased by GM1 at a concentration of 10 micro M, but not at nanomolar concentrations. Activation of ERK1/2 by hydrogen peroxide was enhanced by GM1 at a concentration of 10 micro M and to a lesser extent at a concentration of 100 nM. Thus, the protective and metabolic effects of GM1 ganglioside on PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide appear to depend on the activation of Trk receptor tyrosine kinase and downstream activation of Akt and ERK1/2.

This model is crucial in the search for compounds that diminish 6-OHDA-induced nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cell death. Nephrocizin (luteolin-7-O-beta-d- glucopyranoside), a flavone glycoside, was isolated from widely distributed plants. The protective effects of pre-treatment with nephrocizin on the induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells by 6-OHDA and its oxidative products, H 2O2 and p-quinone, were evaluated herein. Nephrocizin promoted cell viability, scavenged ROS-related products, increased cellular glutathione (GSH) levels, and reduced caspase-3 and -8 activities in 6-OHDA-, H2O2-, or p-quinone-treated PC12 cells. Furthermore, nephrocizin-conjugated metabolites in PC12 cells were identified with the boronate-affinity method and LC-MS technology, and preferential regioselectivity at the C2 and C5 positions by the nephrocizin-GSH (or NAC) adduct method was observed. These lines of evidence established that nephrocizin could form a dimer to diminish the intracellular ROS. These results demonstrate the first neuroprotective mechanism of nephrocizin against 6-OHDA-, H 2O2- or p-quinone-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells via chemical and biological studies.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of Abeta1-42 on the activities of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), two key proteins associated with learning and memory, and the effects of 17beta-estradiol on Abeta1-42- induced changes of CREB and GSK-3beta in PC12 cells. We found that Abeta1-42 induced a decrease in phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 (CREB pS133) and caused a transient (30 min) up-regulation of the inhibitory GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9 (GSK-3beta pS9), followed by down-regulation of GSK-3beta pS9. Pretreatment of 17beta-estradiol is needed for its protection against Abeta1-42-induced changes of CREB. The protective role of 17beta-estradiol against Abeta1-42-induced down-regulation of CREB pS133 was abolished by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitor U0126. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol also prolonged the up-regulation of GSK-3beta pS9 for at least 8 h. However, this action of 17beta-estradiol was abrogated by PKA inhibitor H-89, AKT inhibitor LY294002, and MAPK inhibitor U0126. These results suggest that, while the protection of 17beta-estradiol on CREB is MAPK dependent, its effect on GSK-3beta integrates several pathways.

Because it could repress the oxidative stress in in vivo studies, now we focus on the in vitro studies to investigate the mechanism by targeting the oxidative stress dependent signaling. The relation between the neurogenesis and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains largely unexamined. PC12 cells are excitable cell types widely used as in vitro model for neuronal cells. Most marker genes that are related to neurotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycles are expressed at high levels in these cells. The aim of the present study is to explore the cytoprotection of TSM against hydrogen peroxide- (H2O2-) induced apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms underlying PC12 cells. Our findings revealed that TSM cotreatment with H2O2 restores the expression of bcl-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS), and mitochondria membrane potential. Meanwhile, it reduces intracellular [Ca2+] concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the expression of caspase-3 and bax. The results of the present study suggested that the cytoprotective effects of the TSM might be mediated, at least in part, by the bcl-2-mitochondria-ROS-INOS pathway. Due to its nontoxic characteristics, TSM could be further developed to treat the neurodegenerative diseases which are closely associated with the oxidative stress.

In this study, we investigated whether the inhibition of Rac1 provided neuroprotection in a diabetic rat model of focal cerebral ischemia and hyperglycemia-exposed PC-12 cells. Intracerebroventricular administration of lentivirus expressing the Rac1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and specific Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 not only decreased the infarct volumes and improved neurologic deficits with a correlated significant activation of mitochondrial DNA specific proteins, such as OGG1 and POLG, but also elevated Bcl-2 S70 phosphorylation in mitochondria. Furthermore, the levels of p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR increased, while 8-OHdG, ROS production and Bcl-2/Rac1 complex formation in mitochondria reduced in both Rac1-shRNA- and NSC23766-treated rats. Moreover, to confirm our in vivo observations, inhibition of Rac1 activity by NSC23766 suppressed the interactions between Bcl-2 and Rac1 in the mitochondria of PC-12 cells cultured in high glucose conditions and protected PC-12 cells from high glucose-induced neurotoxicity. More importantly, these beneficial effects of Rac1 inhibition were abolished by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. In contrast to NSC23766 treatment, LY294002 had little effect on the decrement of p-PTEN level. Taken together, these findings revealed novel neuroprotective roles of Rac1 inhibition against cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury in vivo and high glucose-induced neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells in vitro, by reducing Bcl-2/Rac1 complex formation in mitochondria through the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR survival pathway.

Previous studies demonstrated a direct role for EP3 in various neurodegenerative disorders, such as stroke and Alzheimer disease. However, the distribution and function of EP3 in ICH diseases remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that EP3 may be involved in neuronal apoptosis in the processes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). From the results of Western blot and immunohistochemistry, we obtained a significant up-regulation of EP3 in neurons adjacent to the hematoma following ICH. Up-regulation of EP3 was found to be accompanied by the increased expression of active caspase-3 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in vivo and vitro studies. Furthermore, the expression of these three proteins reduced active caspase-3 and Bax expression, while increased Bcl-2 were changed after knocking down EP3 by RNA interference in PC12 cells, further confirmed that EP3 might exert its pro-apoptotic function on neuronal apoptosis.

"35e10834-304e-4f58-836b-244b42945e22","Neuroprotection from secondary injury by polyethylene glycol requires its internalization","Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is well known to both fuse and repair cell membranes. This capability has been exploited for such diverse usages as the construction of hybridomas and as a reparative agent following neurotrauma. The latter development has proceeded through preclinical testing in cases of naturally induced paraplegia in dogs. The mechanisms of action of polymer-mediated neurorepair/neuroprotection are still under investigation. It is likely that the unique interaction of hydrophilic polymers with the mechanical properties of cell membranes in concert with an ability to interfere with mechanisms of secondary injury such as the production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS or ;free radicals) is the basis for neuroprotection by polymers. Here we provide further evidence that the ability of PEG to reduce or limit secondary injury and/or lipid peroxidation (LPO) of membranes requires entry of PEG into the cytosol, further suggesting a physical interaction with the membranes of organelles such as mitochondria as the initial event leading to neurorepair/neuroprotection. We have evaluated this relationship in vitro using acrolein, a potent endogenous toxin that is a product of LPO. Acrolein can pass through cell membranes with ease, inducing progressive LPO in ;bystander cells, and the production of even more acrolein by inducing its own production. Immediate application of PEG (10 mmol l(-1), 2000 Da) to poisoned neurons in vitro was unable to rescue them from necrosis and death. Furthermore, three-dimensional confocal microscopy of fluorescently decorated PEG shows that it does not enter these cells for up to 2 h after application. By this time the mechanisms of necrosis are likely irreversible. Additionally, severe oxygen and or glucose deprivation of spinal cord white matter in vitro also initiates LPO. Addition of potent free radical scavengers such as ascorbic acid or superoxide dismutase (SOD) is able to interfere with this process, but PEG is not. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that PEG is able to rescue mechanically damaged cells, based on a restructuring of the damaged plasmalemma. Furthermore, in compromised cells with an intact cell membrane, PEG must first gain access to the cytosol where this same capability may be useful in restoring the integrity of cellular organelles such as mitochondria, though the intracellular concentration of the polymer must be significant relative to the concentration of toxins produced by LPO in order to rescue the cell.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,27,"Excluded"

However, the mechanisms whereby Apelin 13 protected brain I/R remained to be elucidated. The present study was designed to determine whether Apelin 13 provided protection through AMPK/GSK-3beta/Nrf2 pathway. Method(s): In vivo, the I/R model was induced and Apelin 13 was given intracerebroventricularly 15 min before reperfusion. The neurobehavioral scores, infarction volumes, and some cytokines in the brain were measured. For in vitro study, PC12 cells were used. To clarify the mechanisms, proteases inhibitors or siRNA were used. Protein levels were investigated by western blotting. Result(s): The results showed that Apelin 13 treatment significantly reduced infarct size, improved neurological outcomes, decreased brain edema, and inhibited cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation after I/R. Apelin 13 significantly increased the expression of Nrf2 and the phosphorylation levels of AMPK and GSK-3beta. Furthermore, in cultured PC12 cells, the same protective effects were also observed. Silencing Nrf2 gene with its siRNA abolished the Apelin 13's prevention of I/R-induced PC12 cell injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Inhibition of AMPK by its siRNA decreased the level of Apelin 13-induced Nrf2 expression and diminished the protective effects of Apelin 13. The interplay relationship between GSK-3beta and Nrf2 was also verified with relative overexpression. Using selective inhibitors, we further identified the upstream of AMPK/GSK-3beta/Nrf2 is AR/Galpha/PLC/IP3/CaMKK. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the previous results showed that Apelin 13 protected against I/R-induced ROS-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress through activating the AMPK/GSK-3beta pathway by AR/Galpha/PLC/IP3/CaMKK signaling, and further upregulated the expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"
"36895384-8b5b-4a6f-886f-de6351820ffe","Neuroprotective function of human neuroglobin is correlated with its guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity","Mammalian neuroglobin (Ngb) is involved in neuroprotection under oxidative stress conditions such as ischemia and reperfusion. However, the neuroprotective mechanism remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that human ferric Ngb binds to the alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Galphai/o) and acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) for Galphai/o. In the present study, we used a protein delivery reagent, Chariot, to investigate whether the GDI activity of human Ngb plays an important role in its neuroprotective activity under oxidative stress conditions. We showed that human Ngb mutants, which retained GDI activities, rescued pheochromocytoma PC12 cell death caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation as did human wild-type Ngb. In contrast, zebrafish Ngb and human Ngb mutants, which did not function as GDI proteins, did not rescue cell death. These results clearly show that the GDI activity of human Ngb is tightly correlated with its neuroprotective activity. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Estradiol is a female sex hormone with steroid structure known to provide neuroprotection through multiple mechanisms in the central nervous system. This study was aimed to investigate the signal transduction pathway leading to the inhibitory effects of estradiol against cobalt chloride (CoCl2)-mediated hypoxic death in PC12 cells. Estradiol inhibits CoCl2-induced cell death with genomic DNA fragmentation and morphologic changes such as cell shrinkage and condensed nuclei. Pre-incubation of estradiol prior to CoCl2 treatment attenuated CoCl2-mediated the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and limited the activities of the caspase cascades, such as caspase-8, -9 and -3. Furthermore, estradiol downregulated the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio and decreased the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol in CoCl2-treated cells, indicating that estradiol affect on mitochondrial pathway. Estradiol attenuated also CoCl2-induced upregulation of Fas-ligand (Fas-L) and truncated of Bid in sequence of death receptor-mediated pathway. In addition, estradiol increased the phosphorylation of Akt in CoCl2-treated cells, demonstrating that estradiol has no affect on upstream signaling through the PI3K/Akt in inhibition of CoCl2-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Taken together, estradiol was found to have a neuroprotective effect against CoCl2-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells by the attenuating ROS production and the modulating apoptotic signal pathway through Bcl-2 family, cytochrome c, Fas/Fas-L as well as PI3K/Akt pathway. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: The pharmacological activity of T-VA was evaluated using MTT ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl2- yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)) assay, while cellular morphology was observed with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, immuno-histochemical analysis, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine the expression of VEGF. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used to investigate both VEGF expression and the survival rate after treatment with T-VA. Results: T-VA promoted neuron activity, and the doses of 15 and 30 muM showed more significant effect (p < 0.05). The viability of PC12 cells increased significantly in T-VA (30 and 60 muM) groups (p < 0.05) and increased in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis showed stimulated VEGF expression, and CAM model results showed that T-VA (20 mg/egg) significantly promoted microangiogenesis (p < 0.01). Moreover, in MCAO model, the survival rate of T-VA (60 mg/kg) group reached 86.7 % while for the ischemia group it was 60.0 %. In addition, ELISA results showed that T-VA promoted the expression of VEGF (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings indicate that T-VA helps to prevent ischemic injury by increasing VEGF expression.

After the permanent bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (BCCAo), the animals were treated with saline or PCB, taking samples 24h post-surgery. Global gene expression was analyzed with GeneChip Rat Gene ST 1.1 from Affymetrix; the expression of particular genes was assessed by the Fast SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix and Bioplex methods; and redox markers (MDA, PP, CAT, SOD) were evaluated spectrophotometrically. The PCB treatment prevented the H2O2 and glutamate induced PC12 cell injury assessed by the MTT assay, and modulated 190 genes (93 up- and 97 down-regulated) associated to several immunological and inflammatory processes in BCCAo rats. Furthermore, PCB positively modulated 19 genes mostly related to a detrimental pro-inflammatory environment and counteracted the oxidative imbalance in the treated BCCAo animals. Our results support the view of an effective influence of PCB on major inflammatory mediators in acute cerebral hypoperfusion. These results suggest that PCB has a potential to be a treatment for ischemic stroke for which further studies are needed. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Phosphocreatine (PCr), a high-energy phosphate compound, exhibits a range of pharmacological actions but little is well known of its neuroprotective action. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects and the possible mechanisms of PCr. Diabetes is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases, leading not only to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and but also to central nervous system (CNS) damage. Therefore, we established two rat models of diabetes in vivo induced by MGO and streptozocin (STZ) respectively, while utilized differentiated PC-12 cells in vitro. Treatment of PC-12 cells with PCr markedly attenuated MGO-induced change of viability, apoptosis, accompanied by decreased levels of caspase-3, casapse-9 and Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio. Determination of cellular respiratory function was performed with intact PC-12 cells and homogenized hippocampal neuron tissue of rat. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was assessed by membrane permeable fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The expressions of Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 were examined by Western blot. PCr pretreatment significantly reduced oxidative stress-induced high LDH, MDA level, and ROS production of PC-12 cells. PCr pretreatment also significantly decreased mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. In addition, PCr pretreatment increased the expression of p-Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1, and reduced the apoptosis. Moreover, the expression of Cleaved caspase3 was partially increased and the p-Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 was partially reduced by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). While, compared with LY294002 groups, pre-treatment with PCr at the concentrations of 20 mM significantly reduced the expression of Cleaved caspase3 and increased the expression of p-Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1. Molecular docking assay showed that PCr possessed powerful affinity towards to Akt with lower binding energy. In conclusion, the neuroprotective effects of PCr in vitro and in vivo rely on normalizing mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress via Akt mediated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, suggesting that PCr may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of diabetes-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

Safflower yellow B (SYB) had neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress-induced brain injuries, but the mechanisms were still largely unknown to us. In this study, we tried to investigate the anti-inflammation effects of SYB and the possible roles of AMPK/NF-B signaling pathway on these protective effects. In vivo, brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h and reperfusion for 20 h. Neurofunctional evaluation, infarction area, and brain water contents were measured. Brain injury markers and inflammatory cytokines levels were measured by ELISA kits. In vitro, cell viability, apoptosis, and LDH leakage were measured after I/R in PC12 cells. The expression and phosphorylation levels of AMPK, NF-B p65, and P-IB-alpha in cytoplasm and nuclear were measured by Western blotting. SiRNA experiment was performed to certify the role of AMPK. The results showed SYB reduced infarct size, improved neurological outcomes, and inhibited brain injury after I/R. In vitro test, SYB treatment alleviated PC12 cells injury and apoptosis and inhibited the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and COX-2) in a dose-dependent manner. SYB treatment induced AMPK phosphorylation and inhibited NF-B p65 nuclear translocation both in brain and in PC12 cells. Further studies also showed that the inhibition of NF-B activity of SYB was through AMPK. In conclusion, SYB protected brain I/R injury through reducing expression of inflammatory cytokines and this effect might be partly due to the inhibition of NF-B mediated by AMPK.Copyright © 2019 Shibin Du et al.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",0,0,"Included"

Recent studies showed that Terminalia chebula has several pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The aim of this study was evaluation of the protective effect of T. chebula alcoholic extract (TCAE) on oxidative PC12 and OLN-93 cells death induced by QA. Methods The cells were pretreated with TCAE (6.25-50 mug/mL) for 2 h and then subjected to QA (8 mM) for 24 h. Cell viability and the parameters of redox status including the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were measured using 2-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT), 2,7-dicholorofluorecin diacetate (DCF-DA), thiobarbituric acid and comet assays, respectively. Results Based on Folin-Ciocalteu method, the total phenolic compounds in TCAE were estimated about 1.18%. TCAE at concentration ranges of 6.25-50 mug/mL had no toxic effect on cell viability (p>0.05). Treatment with TCAE significantly increased cell viability following QA insult at concentrations above 25 mug/mL (p<0.01). Cytoprotective potential of TCAE also ameliorated ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage induced by QA. Conclusion These data suggest that TCAE exhibits neuroprotection and oligoprotection potential by means of alleviating oxidative stress parameters.

One of the major gene expression programs triggered by hypoxia is mediated through hypoxia-responsive transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Here, we report the identification and cloning of a novel HIF-1-responsive gene, designated RTP801. Its strong up-regulation by hypoxia was detected both in vitro and in vivo in an animal model of ischemic stroke. When induced from a tetracycline-repressible promoter, RTP801 protected MCF7 and PC12 cells from hypoxia in glucose-free medium and from H2O2-triggered apoptosis via a dramatic reduction in the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, expression of RTP801 appeared toxic for nondividing neuron-like PC12 cells and increased their sensitivity to ischemic injury and oxidative stress. Liposomal delivery of RTP801 cDNA to mouse lungs also resulted in massive cell death. Thus, the biological effect of RTP801 overexpression depends on the cell context and may be either protecting or detrimental for cells under conditions of oxidative or ischemic stresses. Altogether, the data suggest a complex type of involvement of RTP801 in the pathogenesis of ischemic diseases.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",0,0,"Included"

Glutamate neurotoxicity is a process by which the over-activation of glutamate receptors can cause the influx of excessive extracellular calcium and neuronal cell death. It has been proposed that neurons containing CaBP may be more resistant to glutamate neurotoxicity due to their increased ability to buffer calcium. Using a herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) vector system we packaged the CaBP gene, parvalbumin, or the marker gene, P-galactosidase (P-gal), correctly in viron particles, which were found upon infection to express mRNA specific to these vectors. PC12 and neocortical cultures showed strong immunohistochemical staining for either beta-gal or parv. The cortical cultures stained positively for endogenous glutamate decarboxylase, a marker for GABAergic neurons, but not for endogenous parvalbumin, indicating that parvalbumin was being expressed ectopically from the HSV-1 vector. Interestingly, the expression of parvalbumin increased cortical cultures susceptibility to N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced neurotoxicity. This increase in neurotoxicity was not due to the wild-type virus or the helper virus which accompanies the packaging of these vectors. We speculate that the ectopic expression of parvalbumin in cortical cultures may be increasing glutamate release which in turn increases cell death.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

EPS2, an exopolysaccharide with a mean molecular weight of 1.3 x 105 Da, was isolated by ion-exchange and sizing chromatography from the culture of Keissleriella sp. YS4108, a marine filamentous fungus. Compositionally, it is composed of galactose, glucose, rhamnose, mannose and glucuronic acid in an approximate proportion of 50:8:1:1:0.4. The protective effects of EPS2 on peroxide hydrogen (H2O2)-induced cell lesion, level of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities were investigated in the rat pheochromocytoma line PC12 cells. Following a 1-h exposure of the cells to H2O2, a significant reduction in cell survival and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT), as well as increased levels in malondialdehyde (MDA) production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were observed. However, preincubation of the cells with EPS2 prior to H2O2 exposure elevated the cell survival and GSH-Px and CAT activities, and decreased the level of MDA and LDH activity in a dose-dependent manner.

This study is aimed at investigating the antiepileptic effects of protein-rich extracts from Bombyx batryticatus (BBPs) on seizure in mice and exploring the protective effects of BBPs against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells and their underlying mechanisms. Maximal electroshock-induced seizure (MES) and pentylenetetrazole- (PTZ-) induced seizure in mice and the histological analysis were carried out to evaluate the antiepileptic effects of BBPs. The cell viability of PC12 cells stimulated by H2O2 was determined by MTT assay. The apoptosis and ROS levels of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells were determined by flow cytometry analysis. Furthermore, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and glutathione (GSH) in PC12 cells were assayed by ELISA and expressions of caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, Akt, and p-Akt were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. The results revealed that BBPs exerted significant antiepileptic effects on mice. In addition, BBPs increased the cell viability of H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells and reduced apoptotic cells and ROS levels in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells. By BBPs treatments, the levels of MDA and LDH were reduced and the levels of SOD and GSH-Px were increased in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells. Moreover, BBPs upregulated the expressions of PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, and Bcl-2, whereas they downregulated the expressions of caspase-9, caspase-3, and Bax in H2O2-stimulated PC12 cells. These findings suggested that BBPs possessed potential antiepileptic effects on MES and PTZ-induced seizure in mice and protective effects on H2O2-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells by exerting antioxidative and antiapoptotic effects via PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.Copyright © 2019 Meibian Hu et al.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"
"46729c1f-dfed-4bf9-bbe5-1ebcc5fb61dc","Cofilin Mediates LPS-Induced Microglial Cell Activation and Associated Neurotoxicity Through Activation of NF-kappaB and JAK-STAT Pathway","Microglial cells are activated in response to different types of injuries or stress in the CNS. Such activation is necessary to get rid of the injurious agents and restore tissue homeostasis. However, excessive activation of microglial cells is harmful and contributes to secondary injury. Pertinently, microglial cell activity was targeted in many preclinical and clinical studies but such strategy failed in clinical trials. The main reason behind the failed attempts is the complexity of the injury mechanisms which needs either a combination therapy or targeting a process that is involved in multiple pathways. Cofilin is a cytoskeleton-associated protein involved in actin dynamics. In our previous study, we demonstrated the role of cofilin in mediating neuronal apoptosis during OGD conditions. Previous studies on microglia have shown the involvement of cofilin in ROS formation and phagocytosis. However, additional studies are needed to delineate the role of cofilin in microglial cell activation. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the role of cofilin in LPS-induced microglial cell activation using cofilin siRNA knockdown paradigms. The viability of differentiated PC12 cells was used as a measure of the neurotoxic potential of conditioned medium derived from cofilin siRNA-transfected and LPS-activated microglial cells. Cofilin knockdown significantly inhibited LPS-induced microglial cell activation through NF-kappaB and JAK-STAT pathways. The release of proinflammatory mediators (NO, TNF-alpha, iNOS, and COX2) as well as microglial proliferation and migration rates were significantly reduced by cofilin knockdown. Furthermore, differentiated PC12 cells were protected from the neurotoxicity induced by conditioned medium derived from cofilin-transfected and LPS-activated microglial cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that cofilin is involved in the cascade of microglial cell activation and further validates our previous study on cofilins role in mediating neuronal apoptosis. Together, our results suggest that cofilin could present a common target in neurons and microglial cells and might prove to be a promising therapy for different brain injury mechanisms including stroke.

Their values for two descriptors (ClogP, tPSA) of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were calculated for early assessment of the central nervous system (CNS) drug-likeness. Seven of them (6d, 6i, 6k, 6o, 6p, 6s and 6t) demonstrated potential protective effects on corticosterone-induced lesion of PC12 cells although they cannot repair the irreversible oxidant injury to PC12 cells by hydrogen peroxide. Compounds with promising neurorestorative activities (6k, 6o and 6p) were further evaluated for their in vivo effects by forced swim test (FST) and open field test (OFT) in C57 mice models. The FST results showed that compounds 6k, 6o and 6p remarkably reduced the immobility time of the tested mice. Among them, compound 6k was the most potent one, much more effective than Agomelatine and comparable to Fluoxetine. The OFT results showed that mice treated with compound 6k traveled a longer distance than those treated with Agomelatine or Fluoxetine, indicating a better general locomotor activity. The paper also proposed a possible binding mode of compound 6k with glucocorticoid receptor by docking study.

"4985cd6b-175d-4f22-a22b-c32a99c9486e","Neuroglobin protects neurons against oxidative stress in global ischemia","Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a recently discovered globin that affords protection against hypoxic/ischemic-induced cell injury in brain. Hypoxic/ischemic injury is associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In previous studies, we found that Ngb has antioxidative properties, and protects PC-12 cells against hypoxia- and B-amyloid-induced cell death. To further delineate the potential role of Ngb in protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses Ngb. Hippocampal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced by a 10-minute bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries, and the animal brains were assessed 3 days later. CA1 neural injury was determined by cresyl violet staining. Lipid peroxidation was assessed using a malonyldialdehyde assay kit, whereas ROS/RNS accumulation was determined by Het staining in the CA1 hippocampal region. Hippocampal Ngb mRNA and protein expressions were assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Neuroglobin was successfully overexpressed in the hippocampus of Ngb transgenic mice. After ischemia-reperfusion, CA1 ROS/RNS production and lipid peroxidation were markedly decreased in Ngb transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, CA1 neuronal injury was also markedly reduced. Thus, Ngb may confer protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain through its intrinsic antioxidant properties. © 2010 ISCBFM All rights reserved.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

We synthesized a novel 4-HNE scavenger - a carnosine-hydrazide derivative, L-carnosine hydrazide (CNN) - and examined its neuroprotective effect in a model of transient ischemia. PC-12 cells were pre-incubated with various doses (0-50 mmol/L) of CNN for 30 min, followed by incubation with 4-HNE (250 mM). An MTT assay was performed 24h later to examine cell survival. Transient ischemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCO) in the Mongolian gerbil. Animals were assigned to sham-operated (n = 6), placebo-treated (n = 12), CNN pre-treated (20 mg/kg; n = 12), CNN post-treated (100 mg/kg; n = 11), and histidyl hydrazide (a previously known 4-HNE scavenger) post-treated (100 mg/kg; n = 7) groups. Heat shock protein 70 immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region was evaluated 24 h later, while delayed neuronal death using 4-HNE staining was evaluated 7 days later. Pre-incubation with 30 mmol/L CNN completely inhibited 4-HNE-induced cell toxicity. CNN prevented delayed neuronal death by >60% in the pre-treated group (p < 0.001) and by >40% in the post-treated group (p < 0.01). Histidyl hydrazide post-treatment elicited no protective effect. CNN pre-treatment resulted in high heat shock protein 70 and low 4-HNE immunoreactivity in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Higher 4-HNE immunoreactivity was also found in the placebo-treated animals than in the CNN pre-treated animals. Our novel compound, CNN, elicited highly effective 4-HNE scavenging activity in vitro. Furthermore, CNN administration both pre- and post-BCCO remarkably reduced delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region via its induction of heat shock protein 70 and scavenging of 4-HNE.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,117,"Excluded"

For the most active olefin the corresponding arylalkylamine was studied. Novel arylalkenylamines generally possess high r1 receptor affinity (Ki values >25 nM) and good rho1/rho2 selectivity (Kirho2 <100). Particularly, the piperidine derivative (E)-17 and its arylalkylamine analog (R,S)-33 were observed to be excellent r1 receptor ligands (Ki = 0.70 and 0.86 nM, respectively) and to display significantly high selectivity over rho2, mu-, and j-opioid receptors and phencyclidine (PCP) binding site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Moreover in PC12 cells (R,S)-33 promoted the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth and elongation. Co-administration of the selective r1 receptor antagonist BD-1063 totally counteracted this effect, confirming that r1 receptors are involved in the (R,S)-33 modulation of the NGF effect in PC12 cells and suggesting a r1 agonist profile. As a part of our work, a threedimensional rho1 pharmacophore model was also developed employing GALAHAD methodology. Only active compounds were used for deriving this model.

Centella asiatica formulations are used to treat central nervous system disorders. In the present study, asiaticoside, an extract of the plant Centella asiatica, was investigated in CIRI in vivo and vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS We made a CIRI model in vivo in SD rats treated by middle cerebral artery occlusion, and a cell model of ischemia-reperfusion injury was made in PC12 cells treated by deprivation of oxygen and glucose/restoration. CIRI in vivo was assessed by scores of neurological functions, encephaledema, and cerebral infarction area. Inflammation level and oxidative stress level were detected by the appropriate kits. TUNEL assay was performed for assessment of cell apoptosis and Western blot analysis was performed to assess protein expression levels. CCK8 assay was performed for evaluation of cell survival and flow cytometer was used to detect cell apoptosis in vitro. RESULTS Nervous function injury, brain edema, cell apoptosis, infarct size, apoptosis-related protein expressions, and protein expressions of the NOD2/MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway in the CIRI model were all reversed by asiaticoside in rats. The cell apoptosis, inflammation level, and oxidative stress level in the model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury were reduced by asiaticoside. The effects of asiaticoside on CIRI were reversed by NOD 2 agonists. CONCLUSIONS Asiaticoside showed a protective effect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via the NOD2/MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These findings are vital for future research on use of asiaticoside in CIRI, providing a new avenue for alleviating CIRI.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Included","Included",0,77,"Included"
"4c3cfe7f-de53-4a20-a236-7e9e9dcdeb5a","Signaling pathways mediating a selective induction of cytotoxic levels of nitric oxide synthase II by tumor necrosis factor alpha in nerve growth factor-responsive cells","Background: Inflammation and oxidative stress play a critical role in neurodegeneration associated with acute and chronic insults of the nervous system. Notably, affected neurons are often responsive to and dependent on trophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF). We previously showed in NGF-responsive PC12 cells that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and NGF synergistically induce the expression of the free-radical producing enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). We proposed that NGF-responsive neurons might be selectively exposed to iNOS-mediated oxidative damage as a consequence of elevated TNFalpha levels. With the aim of identifying possible therapeutic targets, in the present study we investigated the signaling pathways involved in NGF/TNFalpha-promoted iNOS induction. Methods: Western blotting, RT-PCR, transcription factor-specific reporter gene systems, mutant cells lacking the low affinity p75NTR NGF receptor and transfections of TNFalpha/NGF chimeric receptors were used to investigate signalling events associated with NGF/TNFalpha-promoted iNOS induction in PC12 cells. Results: Our results show that iNOS expression resulting from NGF/TNFalpha combined treatment can be elicited in PC12 cells. Mutant PC12 cells lacking p75NTR did not respond, suggesting that p75NTR is required to mediate iNOS expression. Furthermore, cells transfected with chimeric TNFalpha/NGF receptors demonstrated that the simultaneous presence of both p75NTR and TrkA signalin is necessary to synergize with TNFalpha to mediate iNOS expression. Lastly, our data show that NGF/TNFalpha-promoted iNOS induction requires activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). Conclusions: Collectively, our in vitro model suggests that cells bearing both the high and low affinity NGF receptors may display increased sensitivity to TNFalpha in terms of iNOS expression and therefore be selectively at risk during acute (e.g. neurotrauma) or chronic (e.g. neurodegenerative diseases) conditions where high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the nervous system occur pathologically. Our results also suggest that modulation of NFkappaB-promoted transcription of selective genes could serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent neuroinflammation-induced neuronal damage. © 2005 Thomas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Since hypoxic and neurotoxic insults are underlying causes of PD, and since delta-opioid receptor (DOR) is neuroprotective against hypoxic/ischemic insults, we sought to determine whether DOR activation could protect the cells from damage induced by hypoxia and/or MPP+ by regulating PINK1 and caspase 3 expressions. We exposed PC12 cells to either severe hypoxia (0.5%-1% O2) for 24-48 h or to MPP+ at different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2 mM) and then detected the levels of PINK1 and cleaved caspase 3. Both hypoxia and MPP+ reduced cell viability, progressively suppressed the expression of PINK1 and increased the cleaved caspase 3. DOR activation using UFP-512, effectively protected the cells from hypoxia and/or MPP+ induced injury, reversed the reduction in PINK1 protein and significantly attenuated the increase in the cleaved caspase 3. On the other hand, the application of DOR antagonist, naltrindole, greatly decreased cell viability and increased cleaved caspase 3. These findings suggest that DOR is cytoprotective against both hypoxia and MPP+ through the regulation of PINK1 and caspase 3 pathways.

We investigated whether the mutant protein alters mitochondrial function. We found that constitutive and doxycycline-induced expression of the mutant AR in MN-1 and PC12 cells, respectively, are associated with depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. This was mitigated by cyclosporine A, which inhibits opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. We also found that the expression of the mutant protein in the presence of ligand results in an elevated level of reactive oxygen species, which is blocked by the treatment with the antioxidants co-enzyme Q10 and idebenone. The mutant protein in MN-1 cells also resulted in increased Bax, caspase 9 and caspase 3. We assessed the effects of mutant AR on the transcription of mitochondrial proteins and found altered expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 and the mitochondrial specific antioxidant superoxide dismutase-2 in affected tissues of SBMA knock-in mice. In addition, we found that the AR associates with mitochondria in cultured cells. This study thus provides evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA cell and animal models, either through indirect effects on the transcription of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes or through direct effects of the mutant protein on mitochondria or both. These findings indicate possible benefit from mitochondrial therapy for SBMA.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Methods: PC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma) were treated with various concentrations of the non-essential amino acid glutamate for 0.5-24 hours. The effect of glutamate on cell morphology was monitored with electron microscopy and haematoxylin-eosin staining. Cell survival was calculated with the MTT assay. Expression analysis of chaperones associated with the observed phenotype was performed using either Western Blotting at the protein level or qRT-PCR at the mRNA level. Results: Administration of glutamate in PC12 cells in doses as low as 10 muM causes an up-regulation of GRP78, GRP94 and HSC70 protein levels, while their mRNA levels show the opposite kinetics. At the same time, GAPDH and GRP75 show reduced protein levels, irrespective of their transcriptional rate. On a cellular level, low concentrations of glutamate induce an autophagy-mediated pro-survival phenotype, which is further supported by induction of the autophagic marker LC3. Conclusion: The findings in the present study underline a discrete effect of glutamate on neuronal cell fate depending on its concentration. It was also shown that a low dose of glutamate orchestrates a unique expression signature of various chaperones and induces cell autophagy, which acts in a neuroprotective fashion.

Methods: Novel 16-substituted bifunctional derivatives of HupB were synthesized through chemical reactions. The inhibitory activities of the derivatives toward AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were determined in vitro by modified Ellmans method. Cell viability was quantified by the reduction of MTT. Results: A new preparative method was developed for the generation of 16-substituted derivatives of HupB, and pharmacological trials indicated that the derivatives were multifunctional cholinesterase inhibitors targeting both AChE and BuChE. Among the derivatives tested, 9c, 9e, 9f, and 9i were 480 to 1360 times more potent as AChE inhibitors and 370 to 1560 times more potent as BuChE inhibitors than the parent HupB. Further preliminary pharmacological trials of derivatives 9c and 9i were performed, including examining the mechanism of AChE inhibition, the substrate kinetics of the enzyme inhibition, and protection against hydrogen peroxide (H2O 2)-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Conclusion: Preliminary pharmacological evaluation indicated that 16-substituted derivatives of HupB, particularly 9c and 9i, would be potentially valuable new drug candidates for AD therapy, and further exploration is needed to evaluate their pharmacological and clinical efficacies. © 2009 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

The present study was designed to explore the protective effects of eriodictyol against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced neurotoxicity with cultured rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) and the possible mechanisms involved. For this purpose, differentiated PC12 cells were cultured and exposed to 200 muM H2O2 in the absence or presence of eriodictyol (20, 40 and 80 muM). In addition, the potential contribution of the Nrf2/ARE neuroprotective pathway in eriodictyol-mediated protection against H 2O2-induced neurotoxicity was also investigated. The results showed that H2O2-induced cell death can be inhibited in the presence of eriodictyol as measured by assays for MTT and apoptosis. Further study revealed that eriodictyol induced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase (HO-1) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), and increased the levels of intracellular glutathione. Treatment of PC12 cells with Nrf2 small interference RNA abolished eriodictyol-induced HO-1 and gamma-GCS expression and its protective effects. In conclusion, these results suggest that eriodictyol upregulates HO-1 and gamma-GCS expression through the activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway and protects PC12 cells against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides, epidemiological investigation indicates the declining memory is correlated with the lower estrogen level in AD patients. However, the effect of estrogen on CREB activity in AD is poorly known. In this study, we investigated the effect of 17beta-estradiol pretreatment on the phosphorylation level of both CREB and the kinases associated with CREB activation in cells exposed to a sublethal concentration of Abeta1-42. We demonstrated the protection against Abeta1-42-induced changes of CREB by pretreatment of 17beta-estradiol. 17beta-estradiol pretreatment prevented Abeta1-42 induced down-regulation of CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 (CREB pS133). Furthermore, a transient (8 hours) up-regulation of the inhibitory GSK-3beta phosphorylation at Ser9 (GSK-3beta pS9) was detected in sublethal Abeta1-42 treated cells with pretreatment of 17beta- estradiol, and this effect of 17beta-estradiol was abrogated by AKT inhibitor LY294002.

In particular, to test this hypothesis, three main questions were addressed: 1) whether the Abeta peptide can up-regulate both the transcription/translation and activity of KV3.4 channel subunit and its accessory subunit, MinK-related peptide 2 (MIRP2); 2) whether the increase in KV3.4 expression and activity can be mediated by the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of transcriptional factors; and 3) whether the specific inhibition of KV3.4 channel subunit reverts the Abeta peptide-induced neurodegeneration in hippocampal neurons and nerve growth factor (NGF)-differentiated PC-12 cells. We found that Abeta1-42 treatment induced an increase in KV3.4 and MIRP2 transcripts and proteins, detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively, in NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells and hippocampal neurons. Patch-clamp experiments performed in whole-cell configuration revealed that the Abeta peptide caused an increase in IA current amplitude carried by KV3.4 channel subunits, as revealed by their specific blockade with blood depressing substance-I (BDS-I) in both hippocampal neurons and NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells. The inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation with the cell membrane-permeable peptide SN-50 prevented the increase in KV3.4 protein and transcript expression. In addition, the SN-50 peptide was able to block Abeta1-42-induced increase in KV3.4 K+ currents and to prevent cell death caused by Abeta1-42 exposure. Finally, BDS-I produced a similar neuroprotective effect by inhibiting the increase in KV3.4 expression. As a whole, our data indicate that KV3.4 channels could be a novel target for Alzheimers disease pharmacological therapy.

Therefore, we investigated the role of TOPK in experimental stroke. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and reperfusion, and TOPK small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered by intracerebroventricular injection at the beginning of MCAO. After TOPK overexpression and H2 stimulation in PC12 neuronal cells, antioxidative proteins, apoptosis-related proteins and signal pathways were detected by western blot analysis, the levels of the peroxidation products (malondialdehyde and 3-nitrotyrosine) were measured with ELISA. Phosphorylation of TOPK was increased in rat cortical neurons following tMCAO. TOPK overexpression in PC12 cells augmented levels of antioxidative proteins (peroxiredoxin 1 and 2, heme oxygenase 1 and manganese superoxide dismutase), as well as total superoxide dismutase activity, along with inhibition of malondialdehyde and 3-nitrotyrosine upon H2 stimulation. TOPK overexpression increased cell viability and reduced expression of caspase 3 and caspase 12 in PC12 cells in response to H2. The p-ERK level was increased by TOPK overexpression, and antioxidative protection afforded by TOPK was abolished by blocking the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in PC12 cells. TOPK siRNA increased the infarct volume and reduced total superoxide dismutase activity in the cortex in vivo after MCAO. These data reveal that activating TOPK confers neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by antioxidative function, in part through activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.

However, the neuroprotective mechanisms of action of its active ingredients are unclear. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of various organic extracts of Alpinia oxyphylla on PC12 cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury in vitro. Alpinia oxyphylla was extracted three times with 95% ethanol (representing extracts 1-3). The third 95% ethanol extract was dried and resuspended in water, and then extracted successively with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol (representing extracts 4-6). The cell counting kit-8 assay and microscopy were used to evaluate cell viability and observe the morphology of PC12 cells. The protective effect of the three ethanol extracts (at tested concentrations of 50, 100 and 200 mug/mL) against cytotoxicity to PC12 cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The ethyl acetate, petroleum ether and n-butanol extracts (each tested at 100, 150 and 200 mug/mL) had neuroprotective effects as well. The optimum effective concentration ranged from 50-200 mug/mL, and the protective effect of the ethyl acetate extract was comparatively robust. These results demonstrate that organic extracts of Alpinia oxyphylla protect PC12 cells against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide.

Activation of SLICK channels may be important during pathological states such as ischemia, in which an increase in intracellular sodium and chloride can perturb membrane potential and ion homeostasis. We have identified two NFkappaB-binding sites within the promoter region of the human SLICK (KCNT2) and orthologous rat Slick (Kcnt2) genes, suggesting that conditions in which NFkappaB transcriptional activity is elevated promote expression of this channel. NFkappaB binding to the rat Slick promoter was confirmed in vivo by ChIP analyses, and NFkappaB was found differentially bound to the two sites. We verified NFkappaB transcriptional regulation of SLICK/Slick by mutational analyses and studying gene expression by luciferase assay in P19 cells, where NFkappaB is constitutively active. For the rat gene, activation of the Slick promoter was found to be additive in single NFkappaB mutations and synergistic in double mutations. Unexpectedly, for the human gene, NFkappaB exhibited cooperativity in activating the SLICK promoter. The human SLICK promoter constructs were then tested under hypoxic conditions in PC-12 cells, where NFkappaB is not active. Only under hypoxic conditions could luciferase activity be detected; the double NFkappaB mutant construct failed to exhibit activity. Transcriptional regulation of Slick by NFkappaB was verified in primary neurons. The Slick transcript decreased 24 h after NFkappaB inhibition. Our data show SLICK expression is predominantly under the control of NFkappaB. Because neuronal NFkappaB activation occurs during stressful stimuli such as hypoxia and injury, our findings suggest that SLICK is a neuroprotective gene.Copyright © 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

TeTx gains entry into target cells by means of its interaction with lipid rafts, which are membrane domains enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. However, the exact mechanism of host membrane binding remains to be fully established. In the present study we used the recombinant carboxyl terminal fragment from TeTx (Hc-TeTx), the domain responsible for target neuron binding, showing that Hc-TeTx induces a moderate but rapid and sustained increase in the ceramide/sphingomyelin ratio in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons and in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, as well as induces the formation of ceramide platforms in the plasma membrane. The mentioned increase is due to the promotion of neutral sphingomyelinase activity and not to the de novo synthesis, since GW4869, a specific neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor, prevents neutral sphingomyelinase activity increase and formation of ceramide platforms. Moreover, neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition with GW4869 prevents Hc-TeTx-triggered signaling (Akt phosphorylation), as well as the protective effect of Hc-TeTx on PC12 cells subjected to oxidative stress, while siRNA directed against nSM2 prevents protection by Hc-TeTx of NSC-34 cells against oxidative insult. Finally, neutral sphingomyelinase activity seems not to be related with the internalization of Hc-TeTx into PC12 cells. Thus, the presented data shed light on the mechanisms triggered by TeTx after membrane binding, which could be related with the events leading to the neuroprotective action exerted by the Hc-TeTx fragment. © 2013 Cubi et al.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

In this study, we found that isorhynchophylline (IRN) significantly attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced apoptotic cell death and oxidative stress in PC12 cells. IRN markedly reduced MPP+-induced-ERS responses, indicative of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) phosphorylation and caspase-12 activation. Furthermore, IRN inhibits MPP+-triggered apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling-mediated mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. IRN-mediated attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum modulator caspase-12 activation was abolished by diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) or IRE-1alpha shRNA, but not by SP600125 or pifithrin-alpha in MPP+-treated PC12 cells. Inhibitions of MPP+-induced both cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation by IRN were blocked by pre-treatment with DPI or pifithrin-alpha, but not by IRE-1alpha shRNA. IRN blocks the generation of reactive oxygen species upstream of both ASK1/JNK pathway and IRE1/caspase-12 pathway. Altogether, our in vitro findings suggest that IRN possesses potent neuroprotective activity and may be a potential candidate for the treatment of PD.

In this study, artemisinin, a well-known anti-malaria drug was found to suppress sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor)-induced cell death in the PC12 cells and brain primary cortical neuronal cultures. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with artemisinin significantly suppressed SNP-induced cell death by decreasing the extent of oxidation, preventing the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology and reducing lactate dehydrogenase release and inhibiting caspase 3/7 activities. Western blotting analysis revealed that artemisinin was able to activate extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. Furthermore, the ERK inhibitor PD98059 blocked the neuroprotective effect of artemisinin whereas the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 had no effect. Cumulatively these findings support the notion that artemisinin confers neuroprotection from SNP-induce neuronal cell death insult, a phenomenon coincidentally related to activation of ERK phosphorylation. This SNP-induced oxidative insult in PC12 cell culture model may be useful to investigate molecular mechanisms of NO-induced neurotoxicity and drug-induced neuroprotection, and to generate novel therapeutic concepts for ischemic disease treatment.

However, its biomedical implication and molecular mechanisms remain to be intensively investigated. Panaxatriol saponins (PTS) is the major bioactive components extracted from Panax notoginseng, a widely used herbal medicine for cerebrovascular diseases. This study aims to examine the hormetic and neuroprotective effects of PTS in PC12 cells and zebrafish Parkinsons disease (PD) models. Our results demonstrated that PTS stimulated PC12 cell growth by about 30% at low doses, while PTS at high doses inhibited cell growth, which is a typical hormetic effect. Moreover, we found that low dose PTS pretreatment significantly attenuated 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity and up-regulated PI3K/AKT/mTOR cell proliferation pathway and AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO3 cell survival pathway in PC12 cells. These results strongly suggested that neuroprotective effects of PTS may be attributable to the hormetic effect induced by PTS through activating adaptive response-related signaling pathways. Notably, low dose PTS could significantly prevent the 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss and improve the behavior movement deficiency in zebrafish, whereas relative high dose PTS exhibited neural toxicity, further supporting the hormetic and neuroprotective effects of PTS. This study indicates that PTS may have the potential in the development of future therapeutic medicines for PD.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,4,"Excluded"

Other results show that bombesin-releasable calcium stores (BRCS) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are exaggerated in fibroblasts from patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) compared with controls and in fibroblasts from a young control treated with H2O2. We hypothesize that alterations in oxidative stress underlie the exaggeration in BRCS in AD, and that appropriate antioxidants may be useful in treating this abnormality. Two indicators of different oxidant species were used to determine the effects of select oxidants on cellular oxidation status: carboxydichlorofluorescein (c-DCF) to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 4-amino-5-methylamino-2, 7-difluorofluorescein (DAF) to detect nitric oxide (NO.). Various conditions that induce ROS, including H2O2, oxygen/glucose deprivation, and 3-morpholinosyndnonimine (SIN-1), were used to test the ability of alpha-keto-beta-methyl-n-valeric acid (KMV) to scavenge ROS. KMV diminished c-DCF-detectable ROS that were induced by H 2O2, oxygen/glucose deprivation, or SIN-1 in PC12 cells, primary neuronal cultures, or fibroblasts. Furthermore, KMV reduced the H 2O2-induced increase in BRCS and diminished the elevation in BRCS in cells from AD patients to control levels. On the other hand, DAF-detectable NO. induced by SIN-1 was not scavenged by KMV and did not exaggerate BRCS. The results indicate that KMV is an effective antioxidant of c-DCF-detectable ROS. The effects of KMV are not cell type specific, but are ROS specific. The same H2O2-induced ROS that reacts with KMV may also underlie the changes in BRCS related to AD. Thus, KMV ameliorates the effects of ROS on calcium homeostasis related to oxidative stress and to AD. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is still unclear what other cell stressors trigger protein SUMOylation, what mechanisms enhance and maintain the enhanced SUMOylation, and if it is a general protective mediator against other cytotoxic stresses. Here, we show increased levels of SUMOylation and decreased levels of the SUMO deconjugating enzyme SENP3 in PC12 cells treated with the toxic heavy metal cadmium. In addition, SENP3 knockdown reduced cadmium- induced caspase 3 cleavage and cell death in PC12 cells, while SENP3 overexpression enhanced cell death. These results suggest that SENP3 is an important regulator of the cellular response to cadmium stress in PC12 cells. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of decreased SENP3 and increased SUMOylation in ischaemia, and imply that the regulation of SENP3 levels and subsequent changes in SUMOylation could be a cytoprotective mechanism against caspase 3-mediated cell death.

PPP2R2B encodes Bbeta1 and Bbeta2, alternatively spliced and neuron-specific regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. We show here that in PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons, cell stressors induced a rapid translocation of PP2A/Bbeta2 to mitochondria to promote apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of PP2A/Bbeta2 protected hippocampal neurons against free radical-mediated, excitotoxic, and ischemic insults. Evidence is accumulating that the mitochondrial fission/fusion equilibrium is an important determinant of cell survival. Accordingly, we found that Bbeta2 expression induces mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas Bbeta2 silencing or inhibition resulted in mitochondrial elongation. Based on epistasis experiments involving Bcl2 and core components of the mitochondrial fission machinery (Fis1 and dynamin-related protein 1), mitochondrial fragmentation occurs upstream of apoptosis and is both necessary and sufficient for hippocampal neuron death. Our data provide the first example of a proapoptotic phosphatase that predisposes to neuronal death by promoting mitochondrial division and point to a possible imbalance of the mitochondrial morphogenetic equilibrium in the pathogenesis of SCA12. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,4,"Excluded"

We used differentiating PC12 cells to compare the effects of agents from four different classes and then to evaluate antioxidant amelioration: fipronil, perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), dieldrin and chlorpyrifos. The rank order for lipid peroxidation corresponded to the ability to evoke cell loss: fipronil > PFOSA > dieldrin > chlorpyrifos. The same sequence was found for an index of cell enlargement (protein/DNA ratio) but the effects on neurite outgrowth (membrane/total protein) diverged, with fipronil producing a decrease and PFOSA an increase. Cotreatment with antioxidants reduced (ascorbate) or eliminated (Vitamin E) lipid peroxidation caused by each of the agents but failed to protect against cell loss, with the sole exception of chlorpyrifos, for which we earlier showed partial protection by Vitamin E; addition of higher NGF concentrations protected neither against oxidative stress nor cell loss. Despite the failure to prevent cell loss, ascorbate protected the cells from the effects of PFOSA on neuritic outgrowth; NGF, and to a lesser extent, ascorbate, offset the effects of fipronil on both cell enlargement and neuritogenesis. At the same time, the ameliorant treatments also worsened some of the other toxicant effects. Our results point out the problems in concluding that, just because a neurotoxicant produces oxidative stress, antioxidant therapy will be effective in preventing damage. Instead, additional mechanisms for each agent may provide alternative routes to neurotoxicity, or may be additive or synergistic with oxidative stress. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the properties of FM on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress insult in cultured PC12 cells as well as the underlying mechanisms were investigated in vitro. Pretreatment with FM (5, 10 muM) prior to H2O2 exposure significantly elevated cell viability, reduced cell apoptosis by MTT assay, LDH assay, Hoechst 33258 dye staining, and FM also decreased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by DCFH-DA staining and NBT test. Furthermore, FM also reversed the upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, the downstream cascade following ROS. FM protected PC12 cells from oxidative stress insult via down-regulating the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

In this study, we established a model of neurodegenerative disease using PC12 cytotoxic injury induced by glutamate. The cells were treated with 20 mM glutamate in the absence or presence of water extracts of dried Rehmannia root of varying concentrations (70%, 50% and 30%). The different concentrations of Rehmannia water extract significantly increased the activity of glutamate-injured cells, reduced the release of lactate dehydrogenase, inhibited apoptosis, increased the concentrations of NADH, NAD and ATP in cells, ameliorated mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced the levels of light chain 3.

However, whether the protective effect of the carnosine metabolic pathway also occurs in ischemic brain is unknown. Utilizing the model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in mice, we found that carnosine significantly improved neurological function and decreased infarct size in both histidine decarboxylase knockout and the corresponding wild-type mice to the same extent. Carnosine decreased the glutamate levels and preserved the expression of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) but not the glutamate/aspartate transporter in astrocytes exposed to ischemia in vivo and in vitro. It suppressed the dissipation of DELTAPSIm and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation in astrocytes. Furthermore, carnosine also decreased the mitochondrial ROS and reversed the decrease in GLT-1 induced by rotenone. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the mechanism of carnosine action in pMCAO may not be mediated by the histaminergic pathway, but by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity through the effective regulation of the expression of GLT-1 in astrocytes due to improved mitochondrial function. Thus, our study reveals a novel antiexcitotoxic agent in ischemic injury. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",1,33,"Excluded"

Methods: Two neuron-like cells, N2a and PC12, were cultivated for 12 hours in GSD condition in the absence or presence of the lettuce fraction. The cell viability, DNA damage, and proapoptotic or antiapoptotic proteins levels were determined using MTT, comet, and immunoblotting assays, respectively. In addition, the intracellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation levels were measured by fluorimetric methods. Results: In both N2a and PC12 cells, GSD condition significantly decreased the cell viability which was accompanied by increased intracellular reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation level, and oxidative DNA damage. All the GSD-induced neurotoxic changes were inhibited by the lettuce fraction. Lettuce also suppressed the elevated Bax and caspase-3 proteins and decreased Bcl-2 induced by GSD in PC12 cells. Discussion: The present study revealed that lettuce exerts neuroprotective effect through decrease of oxidative stress and inhibition of proapoptotic pathways. Therefore, it has the potential to be used for the management of ischemia-induced neuronal damage.

Several mechanisms for this release have been postulated, and, by using glutamate transporter inhibitors, several authors have established that reversed uptake is the major mechanism through which glutamate is released in acute oxygen/glucose deprivation. We have studied the effect of the slowly transported glutamate analogue L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxilic acid (PDC) preload on glutamate release and cell death in an in vitro model of oxygen plus glucose deprivation with differentiated PC12 cells. As expected, we found that PDC preload inhibits glutamate release induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation, supporting the conclusion that it occurs via reverse transport. In addition, we show that PDC preload but not the nontransportable glutamate uptake inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzytoxyaspartate (TBOA) protects cells against the death induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation, indicating, that PDC entry into the cell is necessary for this protective effect. This protection does not correlate with the extracellular glutamate concentration or changes in proteins synthesis rate and eukaryotic initiation 2 phosphorylation. Oxygen/glucose deprivation induces a significant increase in glutathione levels in both unloaded and PDC-pretoaded cells, but this increase is not due to up-regulation of glutamate cysteine ligase levels. Intracellular glutathione disulfide (GSSG) significantly increased after oxygen/glucose deprivation. It was also interesting that intracellular GSSG levels in PDC-pretoaded cells under oxygen/glucose deprivation strongly correlate with the protection exerted by this compound against cell death. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Included","Included",0,71,"Included"

While rasagiline is metabolized to its major metabolite aminoindan, selegiline gives rise to L-methamphetamine. Cultured PC-12 cells in absence of serum and nerve growth factor (NGF) die by an apoptotic process. Pretreatment of PC12 cells in absence of serum and NGF for 24 h with either rasagiline (1 muM) or selegiline (1 muM) is neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic as determined by Eliza and MTT tests. However, while aminoindan (1 muM), the major metabolite of rasagiline does not interfere with the neuroprotective activities of rasagiline or selegiline in PC-12 cells deprived of serum and NGF, the major metabolite of selegiline, L-methamphetamine (1 muM), inhibits them. In contrast to L-methamphetamine, aminoindan is itself is neuroprotective in this system. Recently it has been demonstrated that rasagiline directly activates PKC-MAP kinase pathway by a concentration and time dependent phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAP kinase. In the present studies the neuroprotective activity of rasagiline is blocked by ERK inhibitor, PD98059 (20 muM), suggesting the involvement of PKC-MAP kinase pathway in the neuroprotection.

We hypothesize that, like cerebral ischemia, isoflurane is inherently neurotoxic. Limited exposure of isoflurane provides neuroprotection via induction of endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms (preconditioning), while prolonged exposure of isoflurane induces neurotoxicity directly by its inherent neurotoxic effects. To test this hypothesis, we treated rat primary cortical neurons at different days in vitro (DIV) and rat pheochromocytoma neurosecretory (PC12) cells with or without Alzheimers mutated presenilin-1 (PS1) with 2.4% isoflurane for 24 h to induce cell damage determined by both MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) reduction and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) release assays. For isoflurane preconditioning, we treated the above cells with isoflurane at 0.6%, 1.2% and 2.4% for 60 min, 4 h prior to a prolonged exposure of 2.4% isoflurane for 24 h. One hour of preconditioning with isoflurane dose-dependently inhibited neurotoxicity induced by 2.4% isoflurane for 24 h in both primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells. This neuroprotection was most dramatically observed in matured cortical neurons (DIV 16) and PC12 cells with over expression of Alzheimers mutated PS1 (L286V). Preconditioning L286V PC12 cells with equivalent two minimal alveolar concentrations (MAC) of halothane (1.5%), but not sevoflurane (4%), also abolished the neurotoxicity induced by 2.4% isoflurane for 24 h.

To provide further insights into the neuroprotective functions of SA, this study examined whether SA can attenuate cobalt chloride (CoCl2)- induced hypoxia damage and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling repression in PC12 differentiated cells. Differentiated PC12 cells were exposed to CoCl2 for 12 h to mimic hypoxic/ischemic conditions and treated with SA at the same time, followed by electron microscopy and analysis of cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) level, and the regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD1)/mTOR/ p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway. Our data indicated that SA can dramatically attenuate the ultrastructural damage of mitochondria induced by CoCl2 and significantly decrease CoCl2-induced ROS production. Moreover, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) was significantly reduced by CoCl2, and this inhibition was relieved by the treatment of SA in PC12 cells, as evidenced by immunoblot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses. The SA effects were blocked by pretreatment of RAD001. The results indicate that SA can rescue CoCl2-induced repression of REDD1/mTOR/ p70S6K signal transduction in PC12 cells.

We explore whether prior exposure to H2O2 (H2O2 preconditioning) protects PC12 cells against the apoptotic consequences of subsequent oxidative damages and what role the ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels play in the preconditioning protection. PC12 cells were preconditioned with 90 min exposure to H2O2 at 10 micromol/L, followed by 24-h recovery and subsequent exposures to different concentrations (20, 30, 50 and 100 micromol/L) of H2O2 for 24 h respectively. We used PI staining flow cytometry (FCM) to observe the apoptosis of PC12 cells. It was shown that 24-h exposures to H2O2 at 20, 30, 50 and 100 micromol/L respectively induced substantial cell apoptosis, which was greatly prevented in the preconditioning cells, indicating that H2O2 preconditioning protected PC12 cells against apoptosis induced by H2O2. Administration of pinacidil (10 micromol/L), an K(ATP) channel activator, significantly attenuated the apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by H2O2 at 30 and 50 micromol/L for 24 h respectively. Glybenclamide (10 micromol/L), a K(ATP) channel inhibitor, significantly suppressed or abolished the protective effects caused by the pinacidil but not by H2O2 preconditioning. However, when both H2O2 preconditioning and pinacidil were co-applied, their protection against the apoptosis of PC12 cells was much stronger than that of the individual one of them. These results suggest that H2O2 preconditioning protects PC12 cells against apoptosis and that the activation of K(ATP) channels is not involved in, but synergetically enhances adaptive protection of H2O2 preconditioning.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Methods: OGSD/R model was constructed using the passage PC12 cells in vitro. The profile of cell apoptosis was estimated by DAPI staining, Annexin V-FITC and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, as well as the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, including procaspase-3 and caspase-12. Results: PC12 apoptosis was induced by OGSD and aggravated after restoration. CCK8 assay indicated that cell activity reached minimum after 1h of oxygen-glucose-serum restoration (OGR). DAPI staining suggested that apoptosis was the most serious after 1h of OGR, causing apoptotic cell nucleus pyknosis, particle spot formation, and fracture of cells with serious apoptosis forming pieces, and nucleus disintegration. The percentage of apoptotic cells exhibited increased trend after restoration, and reached the highest at 1h of OGR. Moreover, the expression of procaspase-3 and caspase-12 were extremely enhanced after OGD, especially 1h after OGR. Conclusions: PC12 apoptosis is induced by OGSD and aggravated after restoration. The apoptosis of PC12 reaches the highest at 1h after OGR, which may provide experimental bases for spinal cord ischemia reperfusion injury treatment.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",1,9,"Excluded"

Here, we provide evidence that, in neuronal cultures from rat cerebral cortex, nerve growth factor (NGF) exerts neuroprotective actions via p75. Incubating cultures with NGF for 1-24 h protected cortical neurons from delayed cytotoxicity induced by brief exposure to glutamate. Delayed neurotoxicity induced by a calcium ionophore, ionomycin, or nitric oxide (NO) donors such as S-nitrosocysteine (SNOC) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), was also attenuated by pretreatment with NGF. RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of p75 and trkB transcripts in cortical cultures, but did not detect transcripts of trkA, a high-affinity receptor for NGF. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but not NGF, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Trks, indicating that NGF does not activate Trks in cortical neurons. Concurrent application of anti-p75 neutralizing antibody markedly reduced the neuroprotective effect of NGF, but resulted in only a modest reduction of that of BDNF. BDNF-induced neuroprotection, but not NGF-induced neuroprotection, was inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Distinct signaling pathways mobilized by NGF and BDNF were also revealed in that NGF but not BDNF stimulated significant production of ceramides, whereas BDNF but not NGF caused persistent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. These results indicate that, although NGF and BDNF both protect cortical neurons from excitotoxicity, the mechanisms involved in their effects are totally different. The present results are, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate the principal involvement of p75 in cytoprotective actions of neurotrophins.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Switches in HIF-1/HIF-2 signaling in chronic hypoxia have not been fully investigated. METHODS: Proliferation, viability, apoptosis, neuronal and bioenergetic markers, mitochondrial function, respiration, glycolysis, HIF signalling, responses to O2 and glucose deprivation (OGD) were examined using tumor PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells continuously grown at 3% O2. RESULTS: Hypoxic PC12 cells (H-cells) exhibit reduced proliferation and histone H4 acetylation, NGF-independent differentiation, activation of AMPK, inhibition of Akt, altered mitochondria and response to NGF. Cellular cytochrome c is increased with no effect on apoptosis. Reduction in respiration has minor effect on cellular ATP which is maintained through activated uptake (GLUT1) and utilization (HK2, PFK2) of glucose. H-cells exhibit resistance to OGD linked to increased glycogen stores. HIF-2alpha protein is decreased without changes in mRNA. Unlike HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha is not stabilized pharmacologically or by O2 deprivation. Capacity for HIF-2alpha stabilization is partly restored when H-cells are cultured at normoxia. In low-respiring SH-SY5Y cells cultured under the same conditions HIF-2alpha stabilization and energy budget are not affected. CONCLUSIONS: In chronically hypoxic PC12 cells glycolytic energy budget, increased energy preservation and low susceptibility to OGD are observed. HIF-2alpha no longer orchestrates adaptive responses to anoxia. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Demonstrated switch in HIF-1/HIF-2 signaling upon chronic hypoxia can facilitate cell survival in energy crisis, by regulating balance between energy saving and decrease in proliferation, on one hand and active cell growth and tumor expansion, on the other.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",3,37,"Excluded"

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) gives a new genre in therapeutic targets for intervention in AD with its neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions. In previous work, we identified that geniposide is a novel agonist for GLP-1 receptor, which shows neurotrophic characteristics to induce the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. The aim of this study is to determine whether geniposide prevents neurons from oxidative damage, and to explore its signaling pathways. The results demonstrated that geniposide increased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), to antagonize the oxidative damage in PC12 cells induced by hydrogen peroxide. LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) inhibited the effect of geniposide increasing of Bcl-2 level by activation of MAPK, MEK and c-Raf phosphorylation in hydrogen peroxide treated PC12 cells. U0126 (a selective inhibitor of MEK) also attenuated the enhancement of geniposide on Bcl-2 level by inhibiting the phosphorylation of p90RSK in the hydrogen peroxide treated PC12 cells. All these data demonstrate that geniposide, an agonist for GLP-1 receptor, regulates expression of anti-oxidative proteins including HO-1 and Bcl-2 by activating the transcriptor of p90RSK via MAPK signaling pathway in PC12 cells. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It was shown that (1) H2O2 induced apoptosis in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner; (2) the preconditioning with 10 mumol L-1 or 20 mumol L-1 H2O2 can significantly protect PC12 cells against apoptosis induced by 50 or 100 mumol L-1 H2O 2, low (5 mumol L-1) and higher (30 mumol L -1) concentrations of H2O2 had no cytoprotections; (3) high concentration (100 mumol L-1) of H 2O2 reduced MMP and expression of Bcl-2, and increased ROS level, but these effects were blocked by preconditioning with 10 mumol L -1 H2O2; (4) the preconditioning with 10 mumol L-1 H2O2 induced overexpression of Bcl-2. These results suggested that the preconditioning with low dose of H 2O2 could protect the oxidative stress-induced PC12 cells apoptosis not only by preventing the reduction of MMP and expression of Bcl-2 as well as increase in ROS level, but also through overexpression of Bcl-2.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In the present study, we investigated the roles of Nrf2 and miR-144 in the protective effects of Rg1 against I/R-induced neuronal injury. In OGD/R-treated PC12 cells, Rg1 (0.01-1 mumol/L) dose-dependently attenuated the cell injury accompanied by prolonging nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, enhancing the transcriptional activity of Nrf2, as well as promoting the expression of ARE-target genes. The activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway by Rg1 was independent of disassociation with Keap1, but resulted from post-translational regulations. Knockdown of Nrf2 abolished all the protective changes of Rg1 in OGD/R-treated PC12 cells. Furthermore, Rg1 treatment significantly decreased the expression of miR-144, which downregulated Nrf2 production by targeting its 3-untranlated region after OGD/R. Knockdown of Nrf2 had no effect on the expression of miR-144, suggesting that miR-144 was an upstream regulator of Nrf2. We revealed that there was a direct binding between Nrf2 and miR-144 in PC12 cells. Application of anti-miR-144 occluded the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway by Rg1 in OGD/R-treated PC12 cells. In tMCAO rats, administration of Rg1 (20 mg/kg) significantly alleviated ischemic injury, and activated Nrf2/ARE pathway. The protective effects of Rg1 were abolished by injecting of AAV-HIF-miR-144-shRNA into the predicted ischemic penumbra. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Rg1 alleviates oxidative stress after I/R through inhibiting miR-144 activity and subsequently promoting the Nrf2/ARE pathway at the post-translational level.

The hypoxia inducible factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) orchestrate oxygen homeostasis and regulate specific aspects of hypoxic adaptation. Here we show the importance of HIF-2alpha dependant signalling in neuronal adaptation to hypoxic insult. PC12 and NT2 cells were differentiated into neuronal-like cells using NGF and retinoic acid, and exposed to acute hypoxia (1% O2). Gene and protein expression was analysed by qPCR and immunoblotting and the neuronal-like phenotype was examined. PC12 and NT2 differentiation promoted neurite extension and expression of neuronal markers, NSE and KCC2. Induction of HIF-1alpha mRNA or protein was not detected in hypoxic neuronal-like cells, however marked induction of HIF-2alpha mRNA and protein expression was observed. Induction of HIF-1alpha target genes was also not detected in response to acute hypoxia, however significant induction of HIF-2alpha transcriptional targets was clearly evident. Furthermore, hypoxic insult dramatically reduced both neurite number and length, and attenuated expression of neuronal markers, NSE and KCC2. This correlated with an increase in expression of the neural progenitor and stem cell-like markers, CD44 and vimentin, suggesting HIF-2alpha molecular mechanisms could potentially promote regression of neuronal-like cells to a stem-like state and trigger neuronal recovery following ischaemic insult. Our findings suggest the HIF-2alpha pathway predominates over HIF-1alpha signalling in neuronal-like cells following acute hypoxia. Copyright © 2017 Martin-Aragon Baudel et al.

The molecular mechanisms of Icariin anti-apoptotic functions are still largely unclear. In this report, we found that Icariin induces the expression of Synoviolin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchoring E3 ubiquitin ligase that functions as a suppressor of ER stress-induced apoptosis. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1 (NFE2L1) is responsible for Icariin-mediated Synoviolin gene expression. Mutation of the NFE2L1-binding sites in a distal region of the Synoviolin promoter abolished Icariin-induced Synoviolin promoter activity, and knockdown of NFE2L1 expression prevented Icariin-stimulated Synoviolin expression. More importantly, Icariin protected ER stress-induced apoptosis of PC12 cells in a Synoviolin-dependent manner. Therefore, our study reveals Icariin-induced Synoviolin expression through NFE2L1 as a previously unappreciated molecular mechanism underlying the neuronal protective function of Icariin.

Herein, we report that oral administration of ABG001 for five days to adult male mice could dose-dependently enhance survival and neurite growth of newborn cells in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) without changes in cell proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells. The ABG001 administration (0.5A mg/kg) enhanced the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) receptor, which induced increases in the levels of ERK, Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in hippocampus. The pro-neurogenesis of ABG001 was blocked by the TrkA receptor inhibitor K252a. By contrast, the ERK inhibitor U0126 attenuated only the ABG001-increased number of newborn cells, while the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 prevented mainly the ABG001-enhanced neurite growth. In comparison with control mice, the mice treated with ABG001 showed a more preferential spatial cognitive function as assessed by Morris water maze and Y maze tests, which was sensitive to the blockade of TrkA receptor. In addition, a single injection (i.c.v.) of aggregated Abeta 25-35 in adult male mice (Abeta 25-35-mice) impaired spatial memory, survival and neurite growth of newborn cells in the DG with reduced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. The treatment of Abeta 25-35-mice with ABG001 could protect the survival and neurite growth of newborn cells through increasing TrkA receptor-induced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, which was accompanied by the improvement of spatial cognitive performance.

Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. The chromatin-specific dye Hoechst 33342 was used to observe nuclear changes. Caspase-3 activity was detected with a protease assay using Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was estimated by CM-H2DCFDA assay.

Results: Pretreatment with Hyp (0.01, 0.1 or 1 mumol.L-1) for 4 h attenuated sodium azide-mediated apoptosis, and the anti-apoptotic action of Hyp was partially dependent on suppressing the production of ROS, inhibition of caspase-3 activity and associated with increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, decreasing the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. In addition, the caspase-3 inhibitor could reduce ROS formation in a time-dependent manner.

Mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 (Mul1) involves in regulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion. This study aims to explore whether Mul1 contributes to brain injury in ischemic stroke and the underlying mechanisms. First, a rat ischemic stroke model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), which showed ischemic injuries (increase in neurological deficit score and infarct volume) and upregulation of Mul1 in brain tissues. Next, Mul1 siRNAs were injected intracerebroventricularly to knockdown Mul1 expression, which evidently attenuated brain injuries (decrease in neurological deficit score, infarct volume and caspase-3 activity), restored mitochondrial dynamics and functions (decreases in mitochondrial fission and cytochrome c release while increase in ATP production), and restored protein levels of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1, a mitochondrial fission protein) and mitofusin2 (Mfn2, a mitochondrial fusion protein) through suppressing their sumoylation and ubiquitination, respectively. Finally, PC12 cells were cultured under hypoxic condition to mimic the ischemic stroke. Consistently, knockdown of Mul1 significantly reduced hypoxic injuries (decrease in apoptosis and LDH release), restored protein levels of Drp1 and Mfn2, recovered mitochondrial dynamics and functions (decreases in mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production and cytochrome c release while increase in ATP production). Based on these observations, we conclude that upregulation of Mul1 contributes to brain injury in ischemic stroke rats and disturbs mitochondrial dynamics through sumoylation of Drp1 and ubiquitination of Mfn2.Copyright © 2019","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

Our aim of research is to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of kaempferol and rhamnocitrin (kaempferol-7-methyl ether) on oxidative damage in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells induced by a limited supply of serum and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The current result demonstrated that kaempferol protected PC12 cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment of cells with kaempferol also diminished intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to H2O2 and strongly elevated cell viability. RT-Q-PCR and Western blotting revealed that kaempferol and rhamnocitrin significantly induced heme oxygenase (HO)-1 gene expression. Addition of zinc protoporphyrin (Znpp), a HO-1 competitive inhibitor, significantly attenuated their protective effects in H2O2-treated cells, indicating the vital role of HO-1 in cell resistance to oxidative injury. While investigating the signaling pathways responsible for HO-1 induction, we observed that kaempferol induced sustained extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in PC12 cells grown in low serum medium; while rhamnocitrin only stimulated transient ERK cascade. Addition of U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2, which is upstream of ERK1/2, had no effect on kaempferol- or rhamnocitrin-induced HO-1 mRNA expression, indicating no direct cross-talk between these two pathways. Furthermore, both kaempferol and rhamnocitrin were able to persistently attenuate p38 phosphorylation.

This secondary injury is partly due to the toxic effects of hemin, an endogenous breakdown product of hemoglobin. Cofilin, an actin depolymerizing factor, controls actin dynamics and has been previously shown to be involved in mediating neuronal cell death in ischemic conditions and during bacterial lipopolysaccharide induced microglial activation. There are limited studies regarding the deleterious effects of extremely high concentrations of hemin released during ICH and its effects on microglia and subsequent cofilin response. Therefore, investigations were conducted to study the effects of hemin on microglial activation induced inflammation and the critical role of cofilin in mediating the response. We observed that hemin treated microglia had a concentration dependent increase in cofilin expression and NO production. There were increased levels of iNOS, TNF-alpha, HO1, Nrf2, Wfs-1, XBP-1 and spliced XBP-1 observed in response to hemin treatment and the signaling was found to be partly mediated by cofilin. Acute hemin treatment did not evoke Ca(2+) signaling and long-term treatment of hemin also resulted in the failure of microglial response to acetylcholine-evoked Ca(2+) signaling. Knockdown of cofilin by siRNA also reduced acetylcholine-evoked Ca(2+) signaling. These studies demonstrate that cofilin signaling is important in hemin-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, ER stress, microglial migration, and the ability to evoke Ca(2+) signaling. Therefore, cofilin inhibition could be a potential therapy in brain injuries triggered by hemin toxicity in conditions like ICH.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

We recently discovered that caffeic acid derivative N-propargyl caffeamide (PACA) not only potentiated NGF-induced neurite outgrowth but also attenuated 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxicity in neuronal culture. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PACA could increase NGF levels against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity in a mouse PD model. We induced parkinsonism in mice by intraperitoneal injection of MPTP for seven consecutive days. Animal motor functions were assessed by rotarod test and pole test. Our results showed that PACA ameliorated motor impairments in MPTP-challenged mice. Based on Western blot analysis and/or immunofluorescence staining of NGF and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), PACA preserved TH levels in the midbrain substantia nigra pars compacta. PACA also increased NGF expression while it decreased proNGF accumulation. Interestingly, NGF was widely induced in the midbrains including astrocytes. To elucidate the mechanisms by which PACA induces NGF, we focused on the effects of PACA on two neurotrophic signaling pathways, the PI3K and MEK pathways. We found that PACA induced the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and CREB against MPTP-mediated alterations. Importantly, PACA increased NGF levels and subsequently induced TrkA activation in MPTP-treated mice. Consistently, PACA also increased NGF levels in dopaminergic PC12 cells and primary rat midbrain neurons against N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP(+)) toxicity. ERK and PI3K inhibitors attenuated the effects of PACA on NGF levels. Collectively, our results suggest that PACA may rescue NGF insufficiency via sequential activation of PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2, and CREB signaling pathways.

Both heat shock proteins and endothelin are upregulated after peripheral nerve injury, but HSP regulation after injury has not been systematically studied in peripheral nerve. The purpose of this study was to examine the regulation of small and large heat shock proteins after injury to rat sciatic nerve. Secondly, using a parallel tissue culture model for the sciatic nerve (PC12 cells), we examined potential regulation of heat shock proteins by endothelin. Western analysis of constricted, mobilized or unperturbed nerve was used to examine HSP abundance after injury. Semiquantitative PCR was used to examine heat shock message levels after nerve injury in the dorsal root ganglia. Cultured undifferentiated and differentiated PC12 cells were treated with endothelin, then western analysis of cytosol- and membrane-enriched fractions of these cells was used to examine heat shock protein regulation after endothelin treatment. Heat shock proteins are expressed at very low levels in unperturbed sciatic nerve. Constriction injury of the nerve results in increased expression of small and large heat shock proteins, but no upregulation of HSP message in corresponding dorsal root ganglia. Endothelin treatment of PC12 does not cause upregulation of heat shock proteins. Together these data show that a broad range of HSP is involved in endogenous response to peripheral nerve injury and deserve further study as potential neuroprotectants.

NOX2, a cytochrome subunit of NOX, transports electrons across the plasma membrane to generate ROS, leading to physiological and pathological processes. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) can be rapidly induced by oxidative stress and other noxious stimuli in the brain or other tissues. Astaxanthin (ATX), a carotenoid with antioxidant properties, is 100-1000 times more effective than vitamin E. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of ATX on MPP+-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells.Results: MPP+ significantly decreased MTT levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Hemin, SnPPIX and ATX didnt exhibit any cytotoxic effects on PC12 cells. Pretreatment with ATX (5, 10, 20 muM), caused intracellular ROS production in the MPP+ group to decrease by 13.06%, 22.13%, and 27.86%, respectively. MPP+ increased NOX2, NRF2 and HO-1 protein expression compared with control (p < 0.05). Co-treatment with hemin or ATX suppressed NOX2 expression (p < 0.01), and greatly increased NRF2 and HO-1 expression (p < 0.01). MPP+ treatment up-regulated both NOX2 (p < 0.01) and HO-1 (p < 0.01) mRNA levels. Co-treatment with hemin or ATX significantly increased HO-1 mRNA levels (p < 0.01), and decreased NOX2 mRNA levels (p < 0.01). MPP+ increased NOX2 and HO-1 expression with considerable fluorescence extending out from the perinuclear region toward the periphery; this was attenuated by DPI. Co-treatment with hemin or ATX significantly up-regulated HO-1 expression and decreased NOX2 expression with considerable fluorescence intensity (stronger than the control and MPP+ groups).Conclusions: ATX suppresses MPP+-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells via the HO-1/NOX2 axis.

Sesamin is known for neuroprotection by its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties but it lacks blood-brain barrier (BBB) activity. A panel of sesamin derivatives was screened and 3-bis (3-methoxybenzyl) butane-1,4-diol (BBD) was selected for high BBB activity and tested for its neuroprotective effect. METHODS: The focal cerebral ischemia of Sprague-Dawley rats and hypoxia models of murine BV-2 microglia or PC12 cells under oxygen/glucose deprivation were used for in vivo and in vitro test, respectively. Lipid peroxidation and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity from the ischemic brain were tested and reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokine production, prostaglandin (PGE2) and related signaling pathways from hypoxic cells were examined by ELISA or Western blot assay, respectively. RESULTS: BBD showed a protective effect when given 90 min after the focal cerebral ischemia. It also reduced lipid peroxidation and preserved SOD activity from the ischemic brain. The mechanism of BBD was further confirmed by attenuating ROS, cytokine production, and PGE2 release from hypoxic BV-2 or PC12 cells. BBD significantly reduced hypoxia-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and modulated AKT-1 and caspase-3 (survival and apoptotic pathways) in BV-2 cells, and inhibited hypoxia-induced JNK and cyclooxygenase-2 activation in PC12 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The neuroprotective effect of BBD on ischemia/hypoxia models was involved with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The result would help the development of new CNS drug for protection of ischemia/hypoxia injury.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Included","Included",0,1,"Included"

Cell viability tests and Hoechst 33342 staining comfirmed that GlcNAc-Sal pretreatment attenuated SNP-stimulated apoptotic cell death in HT22 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) production and apoptosis-related gene and protein expression suggest that the protection of GlcNAc-Sal, shown in this study, might be mediated by inhibiting intracellular ROS and NO production, and regulating apoptosis-related gene and protein expression during SNP stimulation.

Method(s): NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were treated with 1 muM SMC, 1 muM SA or 0.5 muM SMC plus 0.5 muM SA for 2 days. Subsequently, cells were further treated by 150 muM KA. Result(s): KA suppressed Bcl-2 mRNA expression, enhanced Bax mRNA expression and casued cell death. SMC was greater than SA, and similar as SMC+SA in increasing Bcl-2 mRNA expression. SMC+SA led to greater increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and cell survival than SMC or SA alone. SMC+SA resulted in more reduction in reactive oxygen species and tumor necrosis factor-alpha generation, more increase in glutathione content and glutathione reductase activity than SMC or SA alone. KA up-regulated protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38). SMC or SA pre-treatments alone limited protein expression of both factors. SMC+SA resulted in more suppression in NF-kappaB p65 and p-p38 expression. KA decreased glutamine level, increased glutamate level and stimulated calcium release. SMC pre-treatments alone reversed these alterations. SMC alone elevated glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and mRNA expression. SMC+SA led to greater GS activity and mRNA expression than SMC pre-treatments alone. Conclusion(s): These findings suggested that this combination, SMC+SA, might provide greater protective potent for neuronal cells.Copyright © The author(s).","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

The inhibitory strategy of them is believed to be the promising treatment of stroke. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of equol (0.625-2.5 mg.kg-1, i.g. for 3 days), a predominant active metabolite of daidzein, on neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats and the underlying mechanisms. We found that equol decreased the mortality, neurological deficit, brain histological damage, infarct volume, serum lactate dehydrogenase activity and malondialdehyde content in a dose-dependent manner in rats with 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 22-h reperfusion. Western blot analysis revealed that protein levels of gp91phox and phosphorylated Src-Tyr416 (p-Src) in ischemic cerebral cortex were increased in rats treated with vehicle, which was reversed in animals treated with equol. In rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) with hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, silencing of gp91phox with specific siRNA did not affect the increase of p-Src level by hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and the inhibition of p-Src level by equol, while silencing of Src suppressed the upregulation of gp91phox by hypoxia/reoxygenation injury and enhanced the inhibitory effect of equol on gp91phox expression. These results demonstrate that equol confers a neuroprotection in rats via inhibiting the activation of Src and upregulation of gp91phox induced by focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, and Src may play a partial role in regulating gp91phox expression of neurons.Copyright © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",0,0,"Included"

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects and potential mechanisms of SNH against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced oxidative stress. We demonstrated that SNH pretreatment significantly attenuated MPP+-induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells. In addition, SNH attenuated the effect of MPP+ on the expression of the pro-apoptotic factors Bax and caspase-3. Meanwhile, SNH prevented oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, cytochrome C release, and malondialdehyde levels while increasing antioxidant enzyme activity (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase). In addition, SNH inhibited nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and phosphorylation p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Overall, this investigation provides novel evidence that SNH exerts neuroprotective effects via the ROS-mediated MAPK pathway and represents a potential preventive or therapeutic agent for neuronal disorders.

Compound 11 chelated Fe (II) iron, scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), and restored the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Moreover, it enhanced the activity of the antioxidant defense system by increasing the serum level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and promoting the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Compound 11 caused certain improvements in behavior, the cerebral infarction area, and serum levels of biochemical indicators (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, SOD and MDA) in a rat MCAO model. The lethal dose (LD50) of compound 11 in mice receiving intraperitoneal injections was greater than 400 mg/kg. Meanwhile, pharmacokinetic experiments revealed high bioavailability of this compound after both oral and intravenous administration (F = 60.76%, CL = 0.014 mg/kg/h) and a longer half-life (4.26 and 5.11 h after oral and intravenous administration, respectively).

It has been reported that melatonin (MEL), protocatechuic acid (PCA) and hydroxytyrosol (HT) reduce alpha-Syn toxicity. Their effect on the vitagenes system of PC12 cells have not been explored yet. These bioactive can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the inhibitory and destabilising capacities of MEL, PCA, HT, and their combinations on alpha-Syn kinetics and effects on vitagenes system (sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1), sirtuin-2 (SIRT-2), heme oxygenase (HO-1) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp-70)). In vitro techniques (Thioflavin T (ThT), Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM), electrophoresis, MTT assay and qPCR) were used. Compounds, both individually and simultaneously were able to decrease the toxicity induced by alpha-Syn. Concurrently, occurrence of PCA (100 muM) +HT (100 muM) showed the highest inhibitory effect against alpha-Syn fibril formation and destabilisation of alpha-Syn fibrils (88 and 62%, respectively). Moreover, these compounds increased the expression of SIRT-2, HO-1 and Hsp70, contributing to a neuroprotective effect. In addition, the most important result is the increase on the expression of SIRT-2 caused by the combination of MEL + HT + PCA in the absence of alpha-Syn fibrils.Copyright © 2019","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

SJP effectively improves cell viability and reduces extracellular LDH release in PC12 cells after H/R. Moreover, SJP significantly increases SOD activity but decreases MDA levels. Our experiments showed that SJP could significantly reduce cell apoptosis caused by H/R. Our current results demonstrate that SJP suppressed the activation of MAPKs, resulting in a significant decrease in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3, p53 phosphorylation, and cytochrome c release in a concentration-dependent manner. MAPK is closely related to H/R injury. SJP inhibited JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation but did not affect the increased ERK1/2 expression. These results suggested that JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways could be involved in SJP-mediated attenuation of PC12 H/R injury. SJP prevented PC12 H/R injury in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SJP may be developed as a candidate drug to prevent or treat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

In addition, a differentiated PC-12 cell line was used to determine whether minocycline was neuroprotective after trophic withdrawal in a pure neuronal cell line devoid of glia. Results from this study demonstrated that minocycline, but not tetracycline, is protective in in vitro models of excitotoxicity-induced retinal cell apoptosis. Moreover, the protective effects provided by minocycline in retinal cells seemed independent of actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and glutamate receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx. Doses of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) and minocycline that alone provided no significant neuroprotection resulted in enhanced retinal cell survival when applied concurrently, suggestive of distinct signaling pathways, and minocycline was without effect on glutamate-induced Ca2+ influx, as assessed by calcium imaging. Minocycline was also neuroprotective after trophic factor withdrawal, producing a decrease in apoptosis and caspase-3 activation in both retinal cells and the PC-12 neuronal-like cell line. These results support a role for minocycline as a retinal neuroprotectant and demonstrate that the antiapoptotic actions of minocycline in retinal cells do not arise from the blockage of NMDARs or glutamate receptor-mediated Ca 2+ influx but do involve inhibition of caspase-3 activation. In addition, the survival-promoting actions of minocycline may arise via actions on both neuronal and non-neuronal cell targets.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

The cells were exposed to varying concentrations of HEA (5-40 muM) for a period of 24 h and further incubated with 100 muM of H2O2 for an another 12 h. Cell viability, LDH release, MMP collapse, Ca2+ overload, antioxidant parameters (reactive oxygen species generation (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), inflammatory mediators (interleukins 6 and 1beta (IL-6 and IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and NF-kB were evaluated. The results obtained showed that cells exposed to H2O2 toxicity showed reduced cell viability, increased LDH, ROS and Ca2+ overload. However, prior treatment of PC12 cells with HEA increased cell viability, reduced LDH release, MMP collapse, Ca2+ overload and ROS generation induced by H2O2 toxicity. Furthermore, HEA also increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes and inhibited lipid peroxidation as well as reduced IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and NF-kB.

Many biological studies utilizing animal models of DISC1 have indicated that loss of DISC1 functions are associated with pathological psychiatric conditions. Thus, DISC1 protein stability is a prerequisite to its goal in governing neural function, and modulating the protein stability of DISC1 may be a key target for understanding underlying pathology, as well promising drug discovery strategies. Nonetheless, a half-life of DISC1 protein has remained unexplored. Here, we determine for the first time the half-life of DISC1, which are regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome cascade. Overexpression of PDE4B2, a binding partner of DISC1, prolonged the half-life of DISC1, whereas NDEL1 does not alter DISC1 protein stability. Notably, the half-life of DISC1 is diminished under hypoxia stress by increasing protein degradation of DISC1, suggesting that alteration of DISC1 stability may be involved in hypoxia stress-mediated pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke.

Cells undergoing apoptosis were identified by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting after 18 h. Cell death induced by TNFalpha was decreased 89% after E treatment and increased 2-fold after P treatment compared with cells treated with TNFalpha alone. Treatment with E for 24 h before TNFalpha exposure was required for maximum neuroprotection, whereas P-enhanced death was maximal after a 30-min P treatment. TNFalpha induced a 3-fold increased activity of c-JUN-N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 in d PC12 cells within 20 min that could be increased 5- to 8-fold by P together with TNFalpha. A peptide inhibitor of JNK1 abrogated P enhancement of TNFalpha-mediated dPC12 death but had only a minimal effect on cell death by TNFalpha alone. Inhibition of caspase-8 activation reduced death induced by TNFalpha alone but was much less effective for P+TNF. P alone did not activate caspase-8. E increased estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and Bcl-xL expression and all but abolished TNFalpha receptor 1 (TNFR1) expression. P decreased ERalpha and Bcl-xL expression and doubled TNFR1 expression.

Moreover, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (SPRED1), and Raf-1 are also involved in physiological processes of vascular endothelial cells (ECs). This study investigated how miR-126 changes with reperfusion time in different brain tissues after global cerebral ischemia and focal cerebral ischemia and examined the underlying mechanism miR-126 involving VEGFA, SPRED1, and Raf-1 after I-R. The results indicated decreases in the levels of miR-126-3p and miR-126-5p expression in mice and gerbils after I-R, consistent with the results after oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) in PC12 cells. Glial cells were activated as neuronal damage gradually increased after I-R. Inhibition of miR-126-3p exacerbated the OGD/R-induced cell death and reduced cell viability. After miR-126-3p inhibition, the levels of SPRED1 and VEGFA expression were increased, and p-Raf-1 expression was decreased after OGD/R. Moreover, based on the intervention of miR-126-3p inhibition, we found that the expression of p-Raf-1 was significantly increased after the intervention of siSPRED1, while it was not statistically significant after intervention of siVEGFA.

We used an acute rat model in which oxidative stress damage was induced in the brain by focal ischemia and reperfusion. The inhalation of H(2) gas markedly suppressed brain injury by buffering the effects of oxidative stress.

Methods: We investigated the neuroprotective and neurotrophic activities of puerarin in MPTP-lesioned mice and dopaminergic PC12 cells. The effects of puerarin on ERK1/2, Akt, Nrf2, and HO-1 were assessed by Western blotting. The neurite outgrowth was assayed by neurite outgrowth staining kit. Results: Puerarin protected dopaminergic cells and ameliorated the behavioral impairments in MPTP-lesioned mice. Puerarin potentiated the effect of NGF on neuritogenesis in PC12 cells by >10-fold. Mechanistic studies revealed: (1) puerarin rapidly activated ERK1/2 and Akt, leading to the activation of Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathways; (2) ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and HO-1 inhibitors attenuated the neuritogenic activity of puerarin.

Ethyl gallate (EG) is the ethyl ester of gallic acid which has been acknowledged as an antioxidant. We previously demonstrated that EG effectively inhibited H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and decreased the ROS levels in PC12 cells, while the relevant mechanisms of action of this compound remain largely uncharacterized. The present study was carried out in an attempt to clarify the underlying mechanisms of EG against H2O2-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. EG pretreatment attenuated H2O2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by the decreased caspase-9/-3 activation, PARP cleavage, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depletion, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release and ROS overproduction. Furthermore, EG treatment resulted in nuclear translocation of Nrf2 along with increased expression of ARE-dependent cytoprotective genes, such as gamma-GCS and NQO1, which indicated EG as an Nrf2 pathway activator. Silencing of Nrf2 signaling by siRNA abrogated the protective effects offered by EG on H2O2-induced PC12 cells injury, which suggested the important role of Nrf2 pathway in the protection of EG against oxidative stress induced PC12 cell apoptosis. These results taken together indicated that EG protects PC12 cells against H2O2-induced cell mitochondrial dysfunction possibly through activation of Nrf2 pathway.

In the present study, we showed that the neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide Abeta25-35 caused a dose-dependent (0.1-10 muM) and time-dependent (> 12 h) enhancement of both inactivating and non-inactivating components of voltage-dependent K+ (VGK) currents in nerve growth factor-differentiated rat phaeochromocytoma (PC-12) cells and primary rat hippocampal neurones. Similar effects were exerted by Abeta1-42, but not by the non-neurotoxic Abeta35-25 peptide. Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-42 caused an early (15-20 min) increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This led to an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which peaked at 3 h and lasted for 24 h; ROS production seemed to trigger the VGK current increase as vitamin E (50 muM) blocked both the Abeta25-35- and Abeta1-42-induced ROS increase and VGK current enhancement. Inhibition of protein synthesis (cycloheximide, 1 mug/mL) and transcription (actinomycin D, 50 ng/mL) blocked Abeta25-35-induced VGK current enhancement, suggesting that this potentiation is mediated by transcriptional activation induced by ROS. Interestingly, the specific nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor SN-50 (5 muM), but not its inactive analogue SN-50M (5 muM), fully counteracted Abeta1-42- or Abeta25-35-induced enhancement of VGK currents, providing evidence for a role of this family of transcription factors in regulating neuronal K+ channel function during exposure to Abeta. © 2005 International Society for Neurochemistry.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

The purpose of this study was to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanisms of action underlying the Terminalia chebula extracts and ellagic acid by using beta-amyloid25-35 (Abeta25-35)-induced cell toxicity in an undifferentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. Materials and Methods: The T. chebula extracts were prepared using the methanol, water, and 95% ethanol. Specifically, the ellagic acid was obtained in our laboratory. Assays including cell toxicity and changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium level were evaluated to examine the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of the T. chebula extracts and ellagic acid. Results: The methanolic and water extracts of T. chebula and ellagic acid exhibited the strongest neuroprotective activity against Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cell damages at 0.5-5.0 betag/ml. The ellagic acid also exhibited partial neuroprotective activity against H2O2-induced PC12 cell damages at 0.5-5.0 betag/ml. The methanolic and water extracts of T. chebula and ellagic acid protected PC12 cells from Abeta25-35-mediated cell damages and enhanced cell viability thorough two key mechanisms by: (1) inhibiting ROS production and (2) reducing calcium ion influx. Conclusion: The T. chebula represents a promising plant-source as medicine in the application for the treatment of AD. Further investigation focusing on the active component of T. chebula extracts e.g., ellagic acid is crucial to verify the neuroprotective efficacy and mechanisms in vivo.

Previous study in our laboratory reported that ligustrazine-benzoic acid derivatives have been shown to exhibit beneficial effect against CoCl2-induced neurotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells. To further improve ligustrazines neuroprotection, we integrated the ligustrazine and phenolic acid fragments into one molecule via an amide bond based on structural combination. RESULTS: In this study, 12 novel ligustrazine-phenolic acid derivatives were synthesized and nine others were prepared by improved methods. Furthermore, these compounds were evaluated for their protective effects against CoCl2-induced neurotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells. The amides conjunctional derivatives exhibited promising neuroprotective activities in comparison with ligustrazine. In addition, the most active congener (E)-3-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)-N-((3,5,6-trimethylpyrazin-2-yl)methyl)acrylamide (L10, EC50 = 25 muM), which is 2 times higher than that of ligustrazine, may be a potential candidate for intervention in neurological diseases. Structure-activity relationship was discussed briefly. CONCLUSIONS: Results of series of ligustrazinyl amides enrich the study of ligustrazine derivatives with neuroprotective effects.

In the present study, an injury model based on glutamate-induced cell death of rat pheochromocytoma cells was used to investigate the neuroprotective potential of paeonol and its mechanism of action. Our findings showed that paeonol dose-dependently prevented glutamate-induced cell death as evidenced by cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, and trypan blue exclusion. In addition, flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells revealed that paeonol pretreatment reduced the level of glutamate-induced apoptosis in pheochromocytoma cells. Paeonol was also able to decrease the glutamate-induced injury of mitochondria by normalization of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. The glutamate-induced activity of caspase-3 and p-ERK were dose-dependently reduced by paeonol pretreatments. Taken together, our data suggest that paeonol develops its neuroprotective effect against glutamate neurotoxicity through inhibition of the apoptotic signaling pathway and upregulation of the p-ERK pathway. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

Protecting against oxidative stress damage is an important strategy to prevent and treat AD. Di-Huang-Yi-Zhi (DHYZ) is a Chinese medicine used for the treatment of AD, but its mechanism remains unknown. This study is aimed to investigate the effect of DHYZ on H2O2 induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells. METHODS: PC12 cells were treated with H2O2 and DHYZ. Cell proliferation was detected by Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cytotoxicity of H2O2 was measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Apoptosis were identified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Caspase 3 activity was detected by commercial kit. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was detected by JC-1 staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was 2', 7'-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) staining. Protein expression and phosphorylation was identified by western blot. RESULTS: The results showed that DHYZ antagonized H2O2-mediated cytotoxicity and proliferation inhibition. DHYZ reduced ROS production, stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibit Caspase-3 activity and apoptosis induced by H2O2. In addition, DHYZ inhibited the phosphorylation of ASK1, JNK1/2/3 and p38 MAPK which were up-regulated by H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that DHYZ protected PC12 cells from H2O2-induced oxidative stress damage and was related to inhibition of ROS production and ASK1-JNK/p38 MAPK signaling. The present study provides experimental evidence for the application of DHYZ for the management of oxidative stress damage and AD.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

In this model, nerve growth factor (NGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) improve PC12 cell survival. K252a, a specific inhibitor of NGF-induced trk p140 autophosphorylation, did not alter the neuroprotection provided by EGF or bFGF, yet it completely abolished the protection provided by NGF. Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) with dibutyryl-cAMP also protected during ischemia, although it was not additive with the effect provided by growth factors. Furthermore, growth factors protected a PKA-deficient mutant as effectively as the parental cell line; thus, activation of PKA is protective against ischemia but is not necessary for the action of peptide growth factors. Neither the stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) with acute phorbol ester treatment nor the downregulation of PKC with chronic high-dose phorbol ester treatment resulted in an altered response to growth factors in either the PC12 wild type or PKA- deficient mutant. Thus, protection by peptide growth factors depends on neither PKA nor PKC. Furthermore, downregulation of PKC alone was protective, indicating that PKC may contribute to toxicity. Interestingly, treatment with the kinase inhibitor H-7 was neuroprotective and may have enhanced the neuroprotective effect of NGF. In contrast, staurosporine, a broadly acting kinase inhibitor, inhibited the neuroprotective effect of NGF, but not of EGF or FGF. The protective effects of the peptide growth factors did not depend upon concurrent protein synthesis, as the inhibition of protein synthesis by anisomycin did not significantly reduce the protective effects of EGF, bFGF, or NGF. Although their precise biochemical nature has yet to be identified, the signal transduction pathways that are regulated by peptide growth factors to protect cells against ischemia are potentially important therapeutic targets.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Cobalt chloride (CoCl(2))-induced cell death in PC12 cells may serve a simple and convenient in vitro model of hypoxia-induced neuronal cytotoxicity. To explore the effect of geniposide on CoCl(2) which induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial function in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, we analyzed the influence of geniposide on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. METHODS: PC12 cells and RNAi PC12 cells were treated with 0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 micromol/L geniposide for 12 hours and then exposure to 400 micromol/L CoCl(2) for 12 hours. Cell viability, cell morphology, and expression of Bcl-2, Bax, P53 and caspase-9 were determined using Western blotting. RESULTS: Pretreatment with geniposide markedly improved the cells viability and morphology, decreased the expression of Bax, P53 and caspase-9, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in PC12 cells challenged by CoCl(2)2. However, in the RNAi PC12 cells, geniposide had no significant effect on the expression of these proteins. CONCLUSION: Geniposide protects PC12 cells from CoCl(2) involved in mitochondrial mediated apoptosis, and GLP-1R might play a critical role in the neuroprotection of geniposide in PC12 cells.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Pile of concrete evidence imply metformin as an Insulin sensitizer may enhance Akt/mTOR activity however the significance of Akt/mTOR recruitment has not yet been revealed in metformin induced neuroprotection against oxidative stress. Main methods In the current study using H2O2 induced injury in PC12 cells; we first examined metformin impact on cell death by MTT assay and visual assessment. Metformin pretreated cells were then subjected to immunoblotting as well as real time PCR to find PI3K, Akt, mTOR and S6K concurrent transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes. The proportions of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated constituents of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K were determined to address their activation upon metformin treatment. Key findings According to cells morphology and MTT data metformin led to significant protection against H2O2 induced injury in 0.1 and 0.5 mM concentrations. Metformin induced protection concurred with elevated PI3K/Akt/mTOR/S6K activity as well as enhanced GSH levels. These changes paralleled with a profound decline in the corresponding transcripts as determined by real time PCR. Significance Taken together our experimentation supports the hypothesis that Akt/mTOR/S6K cascade may contribute to metformin alleviating effect. The present work while highlighting metformin anti-oxidant characteristics, concludes that Akt/mTOR signaling might be central to the drugs alleviating effects. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We thereby investigated involvement of the MyD88-dependent (MyD88) and MyD88-independent (TRIF) TLR signaling pathways in 2 in vitro and 2 in vivo models of cerebral ischemia. For in vitro studies, we used a model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by flow cytometric analysis to determine:1) viability of PC12 cells following knock-down with MyD88 siRNA compared to negative control siRNA and 2) viability, apoptosis and necrosis of cortical neurons from MyD88 null (-/-) , TRIF mutant, and wild type (WT) mice. In addition, in vivo, 1) We examined CA1 neuronal survival 7 days after global forebrain ischemia and 2) infarct volumes 24 h after Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) in all 3 types of mice. OGD: 1) There were no differences in either percent viability of PC12 cells transfected with MyD88 compared to negative control siRNA or 2) in percent viability, apoptosis and necrosis of cortical neurons from MyD88-/-,TRIF mutant and WT mice.

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway elicits a survival signal to protect against multiple injuries, and the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a downstream target of the PI3K/Akt pathway, can bind to HO-1. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol derived from grapes, has been widely reported to have diverse antioxidative effects against AD, but the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the effects of resveratrol on Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells and to explore the potential mechanisms of these effects. PC12 cells were cultured and treated with Abeta1-42. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. After treating with resveratrol at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40 muM) and for different durations (24, 48, 72 h), the generation of MDA, GSH, and SOD were detected; cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined using an ROS Assay Kit. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression. Our studies showed that pretreatment with resveratrol could reduce Abeta1-42-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells by inhibiting the generation of MDA and ROS and increasing the production of SOD and GSH. Resveratrol markedly attenuated the Abeta1-42-induced loss in cell viability in PC12 cells in both a dose- and time-dependent manner. More importantly, resveratrol stimulated the activation of HO-1, Nrf2, PI3K, and phosphorylated Akt. Notably, the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol were eliminated by the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), Nrf2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), and the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Taken together, the findings suggest that the cytoprotection of resveratrol against the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta1-42 in PC12 cells is through the upregulation of HO-1 expression via the activation of the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 intracellular signaling pathway, which might provide novel insights for understanding the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol as an anti-AD drug.

METHODS: Mature, differentiated PC12 cells treated with MPP+ were used as an in vitro cell model. The MTT assay was used to investigate cell viability after ATX treatment, and western blot analysis was used to observe Sp1 (activated transcription factor 1) and NR1 (NMDA receptor subunit 1) protein expression, real-time PCR was used to monitor Sp1 and NR1 mRNA, and cell immunofluorescence was used to determine the location of Sp1 and NR1 protein and the nuclear translocation of Sp1. RESULTS: PC12 cell viability was significantly reduced by MPP+ treatment. The expression of Sp1 and NR1 mRNA and protein were increased compared with the control (p < 0.01). Following co-treatment with ATX and MPP+, cell viability was significantly increased, and Sp1 and NR1 mRNA and protein were decreased, compared with the MPP+ groups (p < 0.01). In addition, mithracycin A protected PC12 cells from oxidative stress caused by MPP+ by specifically inhibiting the expression of Sp1.

While high levels of oxidative stress are generally associated with cell death, a slight rise of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels can be protective by []preconditioning[] cells to develop a resistance against subsequent challenges. However, the mechanisms underlying such preconditioning (PC)-induced protection are still poorly understood. Previous studies have supported a role of ERK5 (mitogen-activated protein [MAP] kinase 5) in neuroprotection and ischemic tolerance in the hippocampus. In agreement with these findings, our data suggest that ERK5 mediates both hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced PC as well as nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuroprotection. Activation of ERK5 partially rescued pheochromocytoma PC12 cells as well as primary hippocampal neurons from H2O2-caused death, while inhibition of ERK5 abolished NGF or PC-induced protection. These results implicate ERK5 signaling as a common downstream pathway for NGF and PC. Furthermore, both NGF and PC increased the expression of the transcription factor, KLF4, which can initiate an anti-apoptotic response in various cell types. Induction of KLF4 by NGF or PC was blocked by siERK5, suggesting that ERK5 is required in this process. siKLF4 can also attenuate NGF- or PC-induced neuroprotection. Overexpression of active MEK5 or KLF4 in H2O2-stressed cells increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and the expression of NAIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein). Taken together, our data suggest that ERK5/KLF4 cascade is a common signaling pathway shared by at least two important mechanisms by which neurons can be protected from cell death.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

Exposure of PC12 cells to 20muM Abeta25-35 caused significant cell viability loss and apoptosis, Abeta aggregation, mitochondrial and ER morphological changes, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, intracellular calcium elevation, and cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

In doses of 35-100 mumoles/kg administered orally to rats, it inhibits ChE by 25-40% and antagonises scopolamine-induced impairments in spatial memory. After daily administration of 75 mumoles/kg for 2 weeks, TV3326 does not show any motor stimulant effects but significantly reduces immobility in the forced swim test, an action consistent with that of known antidepressants. This could result from more than 70% inhibition of both MAO-A and B in the brain that occurs under these conditions, since it is not shared by the S-isomer, TV3279, which does not block MAO. TV3326 also shows selectivity for brain MAO, even after 2 months of daily administration, with little or no effect on the enzyme in the intestinal tract and liver. This reduces the likelihood of it producing the ""cheese effect"" if administered with tyramine-containing foods or beverages. TV3326 and TV3279 protect against ischemia-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells and reduce the oedema, deficits in motor function and memory after closed head injury in mice.

The expression levels of lncRNA H19 in PC-12 cells were altered by transfection, then cell viability, migration and apoptosis were assessed respectively. Moreover, the cross-regulation between lncRNA H19, miR-28 and SP1 was studied to reveal one of the possible mechanisms of lncRNA H19's function. We found that hypoxia induced remarkable decreases in cell viability and migration, and induced a notable increase in cell apoptosis. Hypoxia-induced cell damage was aggravated by lncRNA H19 overexpression, while was alleviated by lncRNA H19 silence. miR-28 was negatively regulated by lncRNA H19, and SP1 was a target gene of miR-28.

In the present study, we have evaluated the effects and mechanism of miR-22 in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to mimic PD. RT-PCR results showed that the expression of miR-22 is downregulated in 6-OHDA-treated PC12 cells, and the overexpression of miR-22 significantly promoted the survival and proliferation of 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells, whereas miR-22 inhibitor reversed these effects. In addition, PC12 cells were treated with miR-22 mimics or inhibitor following 6-OHDA administration, which medicated ROS production and upregulation or downregulation of caspase-3 activity, respectively. A luciferase reporter assay revealed that transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a direct target gene of miR-22, and miR-22 overexpression markedly downregulated the level of TRPM7. Strikingly, further analysis showed that miR-22 mediated 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cell survival and proliferation by targeting TRPM7. Taken together, the present study showed that miR-22 overexpression exhibited neuroprotective and reversal effects on the 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cell growth and apoptosis by targeting TRPM7.

"97c39ecd-8d3b-4ebe-a87c-589cdf1b62a2","A glutamate-sensitizing activity in conditioned media derived from rat cerebellar granule cells","When cerebellar granule cells that had been cultured in vitro for 8 days were subjected to a cytotoxic glutamate pulse (100 muM, 30 min incubation), the response varied according to cell density and the volume of medium in which cells were grown. Thus, lowering the cell density by a factor of 4 compared with usual conditions (2.6 x 105 cells/cm2) or increasing the volume by an identical 4-fold factor reduced cell death from 90-95% to 20-30%. Addition of a conditioned medium derived from high-density to low-density cultures or to high-volume cultures markedly increased the sensitivity of the cells to glutamate. This glutamate-sensitizing activity, which accelerated by several days the onset of the response of cerebellar cultures to glutamate, was inhibited by actinomycin D and was not detectable in conditioned medium derived from confluent cultures of cerebellar astroglia, or from cell lines such as PC12, GT1-7, 3T3 and CHP 100, Glutamate-sensitizing activity was not mimicked by triiodo-L-thyronine, insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-I), truncated IGF-I, GPE [a tripeptide (gly-pro-glu) derived from IGF-I], brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor or tumour necrosis factor-alpha. However, IGF-I added to cultures of granule cells plated at high density and grown in basal medium Eagles without serum or any other constituent of chemically defined media was capable of supporting production of glutamate-sensitizing activity to an extent similar to that shown by whole fetal calf serum. Under the same conditions triiodo-L-thyronine and BDNF did not support the production of glutamate-sensitizing activity. Glutamate-sensitizing activity was not mimicked by glutamate, NMDA, glycine or lactate, and was not inhibited by glucose, haemoglobin or N-OMEGA-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. At variance with the response of granule cells, the response to glutamate of GABAergic cells present in the same culture was not affected by cell density or by glutamate-sensitizing activity.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Except for P2Y14 which has recently been defined, stimulation of P2Y receptors by UTP and/or UDP augments proliferation of adult multipotent neural stem cells; stimulates dopaminergic differentiation in human mesencephalic neural stem cells; and enhances neurite outgrowth in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and cultured DRG neurons. UTP and/or UDP have been shown to affect neuronal function by depolarizing neurons from cultured amphibian sympathetic ganglia; increasing firing rates of neurons; enhancing presynaptic glutamate release and promoting long-term potentiation; and by stimulating noradrenaline release from cultured sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, by activating P2Y receptors, UTP and/or UDP exhibit neuroprotective effects via induction of microglial convergence and reactive astrogliosis; protection from serum starvation-induced apoptosis; and stimulation of alpha-secretase-dependent APP processing and sAPPalpha release. Antagonism of uridine- nucleotide-stimulated P2Y receptors or the second messengers they generate, or degradation of extracellular uridine nucleotides, can block the effects mediated by these receptors. These observations suggest that uridine-nucleotide-stimulated P2Y receptors may constitute possible therapeutic targets for diseases affecting neuronal survival or function. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are among the most toxic mediators activated by injury. We speculate that part of the TNFalpha toxicity is mediated by its synergism with ROS. Thus, toxicity of TNFalpha and ROS, alone or together, were studied in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were exposed for 18 h to TNFalpha (0-100 ng/ml), to H2O2 (1-300 muM) or to both, each at sub-toxic concentrations. Lactic dehydrogenase release, prostaglandin E2 accumulation and morphology indicated cell death and stress response. TNFalpha toxicity was seen at >50 ng/ml, and that of H2O 2 at >150 muM, however, when together, sub-lethal levels (25 ng/ml TNFalpha and 30 muM H2O2) induced toxicity. Dexanabinol, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist with antioxidant and anti-TNFalpha properties, completely rescued the cells. These findings corroborate our hypothesis on the cooperative toxicity exerted by TNFalpha and ROS after brain injury. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We investigated the ability of HupA to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction in neuron-like rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells exposed in culture to the amyloid beta-peptide fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35). After exposure to 1 muM Abeta25-35 for various periods, cells exhibited a rapid decline of ATP levels and obvious disruption of mitochondrial membrane homeostasis and integrity as determined by characteristic morphologic alterations, reduced membrane potential, and decreased activity of ion transport proteins. In addition, Abeta25-35 treatment also led to inhibition of key enzyme activities in the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as an increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-incubation with HupA for 2 hr not only attenuated these signs of cellular stress caused by Abeta, but also enhanced ATP concentration and decreased ROS accumulation in unharmed normal cells. Those results indicate that HupA protects mitochondria against Abeta-induced damages, at least in part by inhibiting oxidative stress and improving energy metabolism, and that these protective effects reduce the apoptosis of neuronal cells exposed to this toxic peptide. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,4,"Excluded"

Fagonia arabica is an ethno-pharmacologically important Ayurvedic herb known to have many medicinal properties like anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects. However, its antioxidant potential has not been investigated so far. The present study was designed to investigate the antioxidant potential of F. arabica and its neuroprotective effect on chemical ischemia induced in PC12 cells. Chemical ischemia was induced through exposing the cells to uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation sodium azide (5.0 mM) and competitive inhibitor of glycolysis 2-deoxy-glucose (2.0 mM) for 2 h followed by 24 h reperfusion with normal culture medium. Total polyphenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant potential of the herb was measured using DPPH and ABTS*+ scavenging and ferric ion reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assays; its effect on neuroprotection and energy metabolism was also studied. The ischemic injury was characterized by impaired energy status as indicated by decreased ATP levels in the cells, accompanied by increased lactic acid content. Both the changes favourably responded to F. arabica and offered considerable neuroprotection from ischemia and helped to maintain the cellular viability and mitochondrial integrity of the cells. F. arabica showed considerable amount of TPC and antioxidant activity. This study reveals the antioxidant potential of F. arabica and its protective efficacy against ischemia/reperfusion mediated cell death. F. arabica thus can be considered for further studies for the development of the prophylactic or therapeutic agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke. © 2012 by School of Pharmacy.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Swelling-induced mediation of volume-regulated chloride channels (VRACs) is thought to be one of the non-glutamate mechanisms in cerebral ischemia, and CIC3 channel has been proposed as one of the candidates for VRACs. This study evaluates the importance of VRAC channels in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury model using a specific VRAC antagonist DCPIB as a pharmacological blocker.The cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury was induced in P7 (postnatal, day 7) mouse pups. The Rice-Vannucci neonatal adaptation of Levine procedure with minor modifications was used to induce cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal mice. Twenty minutes prior to onset of ischemia, DCPIB was administered intraperitoneally to the animals. The mice, treated with DCPIB, showed a significantly reduced mean percentage of right hemispheric corrected infarct volume compared to the vehicle-treated mice. The treatment with DCPIB also improved functional recovery, as was evident by increased activity of blocker-treated group compared with vehicle-treated group. Additionally, this study provided supportive evidence of the ability of DCPIB to significantly block VRAC mediated cell death in vitro in PC12 cell line under oxygen-glucose depravation conditions, as determined by comparing intracellular chloride ion concentrations in cells treated with DCPIB and control group. These experiments demonstrate the pathophysiological role of VRACs in ischemic brain injury, and suggest the blocker as a potential, easily administrable therapeutic drug targeting VRACs in the context of perinatal and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Included","Included",0,27,"Included"

We induced EPO preconditioning in cortical neuronal cultures that protected neurons from a subsequent in vitro ischemic insult (transient oxygen-glucose deprivation). To investigate downstream changes in protein expression in EPO-preconditioned cortical neuronal cultures, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Overall, EPO preconditioning resulted in protein up-regulation, and, from 84 of the most differentially expressed proteins selected for identification, the proteins or tentative proteins were identified in 57 cases, representing 40 different proteins. Different protein spots representing the same or closely related protein(s) occurred for 13 of the identified proteins and are likely to represent posttranslational modifications or proteolytic fragments of the protein. Two proteins (78-kD glucose-regulated protein and tropomyosin, fibroblast isoform 1) were detected in control neuronal cultures, but not following EPO preconditioning treatment, whereas one protein (40S ribosomal protein SA) was detected only following EPO preconditioning. Most of the other proteins identified had not previously been associated with EPO preconditioning and will aid in the understanding of EPOs neuroprotective response and possibly the development of new therapeutic interventions to inhibit neuronal death in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Included","Excluded",1,4,"Excluded"

Gossypitrin (Gos) is a natural occurring flavonoid and the main bioactive substance from the flowers of Talipariti elatum Sw. (Majagua azul), traditionally used in Cuba as expectorant and antiasthmatic. Only few reports have documented its antioxidant properties. Aims: To evaluate the antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of Gos against cyanide-induced oxidative stress and cell death in PC12 cells. Methods: Gos effects on DPPH/ABTS radical scavenging, ferric reducing power and lipid peroxidation were examined. The ischemia/reperfusion neuronal damage was produced by exposing PC12 cells to KCN in glucose-free medium. Gos was added to the incubation medium 30 min before chemical hypoxia induction. The neuroprotective potential of Gos was assessed by measuring cell viability by the MTT assay, the antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, and GSH and lipid peroxidation levels. Rutin (Rut), the well-known antioxidant, was used as a reference compound. Results: Gos showed a potent intrinsic antioxidant capacity evidenced by low IC50 and EC50 values for DPPH/ABTS/malondialdehyde and ferric reducing power, respectively. Pre-treatment of PC12 cells with Gos, significantly increased their survival against KCN, restored the levels of GSH and the SOD and CAT enzymes activities, as well as reduced the level of lipid peroxidation. Its antioxidant effects were higher than those elicited by Rut. Conclusions: The results show for the first time the neuroprotective potential of Gos against hypoxic cell damage, probably associated to its antioxidant effects.

In the case of 1, formation of the Griess positive pigment (GPP-1) promoted by HRP/H2O2 proceeded through the intermediacy of two main dimeric species that could be isolated and identified as 3 and the isomer 4, featuring the 4-nitro-6,7-dihydroxyindole system linked to a unit of 1 through ether bonds. Spectroscopic (FAB-MS, 1H NMR) and chemical analysis of GPP-1 indicated a mixture of oligomeric species related to 3 and 4 in which oxidative modification of the nitrocatechol moiety of 1 led to the generation of reactive nitro groups supposedly linked to sp3 hybridized carbons. In the pH range 3-6, GPP-1 induced concentration- and pH-dependent nitrosation of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene, but very poor (up to 2%) nitration of 600 muM tyrosine. At pH 7.4, 1 exerted significant toxicity to PC12 cells, while GPP-1 proved virtually innocuous. By contrast, when assayed on Lactobacillus bulgaricus cells at pH 3.5, 1 was inactive whereas GGP-1 caused about 70% inhibition of cell growth.

Here, we report that human Ngb exists in lipid rafts only during oxidative stress and that lipid rafts are crucial for neuroprotection by Ngb. The ferrous oxygen-bound form of Ngb, which exists under normoxia, is converted to the ferric bis-His conformation during oxidative stress, inducing large tertiary structural changes. We clarified that ferric bis-His Ngb, but not ferrous ligand-bound Ngb, specifically binds to flotillin-1, a lipid raft microdomain-associated protein, as well as to alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Galpha(i/o)). Moreover, we found that human ferric bis-His Ngb acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor for Galpha(i/o) that has been modified by oxidative stress. In addition, our data shows that Ngb inhibits the decrease in cAMP concentration that occurs under oxidative stress, leading to protection against cell death. Furthermore, by using a mutated Ngb protein that cannot form the bis-His conformation, we demonstrate that the oxidative stress-induced structural changes of human Ngb are essential for its neuroprotective activity.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Recent papers support the hypothesis that neuronal apoptosis and cerebral ischemia induce the robust activation of MAPK cascades. Although extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathways promote cell survival and proliferation, and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases/p38 pathways induce apoptosis in general, the roles of MAPK cascades in neuronal death and survival seem to be complicated and altered by the type of cells and the magnitude and timing of insults. Some specific inhibitors of MAPK cascades provide important information in clarifying the roles of each molecule in neuronal death and survival, but the results are still controversial.

The addition of QGR, N-acetyl cysteine, or Bay 11-7085 attenuated the cholesterol oxidation product-induced changes in the apoptosis-related protein levels, activation of NF-kappaB, formation of reactive oxygen species, depletion of glutathione (GSH), nuclear damage, and cell death. The results show that QGR may attenuate the cholesterol oxidation product-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells by suppressing the activation of the mitochondrial pathway and the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathways that is mediated by NF-kappaB activation.

The results showed that CA reduced 52% of the infarct volume from brains under ischemia/reperfusion in vivo and protected the PC12 cells from hypoxic injury in vitro. CA (1.0 muM) enhanced cell viability, prevented lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release, scavenged reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased superoxide dismutase activity, and attenuated Ca2+ release, lipid peroxidation, and prostaglandin E2 production in hypoxic PC12 cells.

Methods We report on the investigation at gene level, through quantitative real time RT-PCR, of the effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles on ROS mechanisms in neuron-like PC12 cells. After three days of treatment, transcription of 84 genes involved in antioxidant defense, in ROS metabolism, and coding oxygen transporters is evaluated, and its relevance to central nervous system degenerative diseases is considered. Results Experimental evidences reveal intriguing differences in transcriptional profiles of cells treated with cerium oxide nanoparticles with respect to the controls: nanoceria acts as strong exogenous ROS scavenger, modulating transcription of genes involved in natural cell defenses, down-regulating genes involved in inflammatory processes, and up-regulating some genes involved in neuroprotection.

Therefore, the neurodegeneration following anesthesia in a variety of animal models has attracted our attention. Neurotoxic effects of ketamine cannot be ignored. In contrast, some anesthetics, including midazolam, protect neurons and increase dendritic spine density. However, the mechanism of neuroprotection by midazolam is not clear, and whether midazolam can relieve the damage caused by ketamine is unknown. Therefore, in this study, we explored the effects of midazolam on ketamine anesthesia. We measured protein levels of cleaved-caspase-3 (c-caspase-3), beclin-1, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), autophagy-related gene 4 (ATG4), ATG5, p62 (SQSTM1), and the autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3) in hippocampus by Western analysis. We also measured total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in hippocampus and PC12 cells. Results showed that ketamine induced apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial pathway by increasing the expression of c-caspase-3 and Bax, and decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 at the protein level. Ketamine also increased the expression of LC3II and ATG5, proteins, decreased the expression of ATG4 and P62, and finally induced autophagy. Ketamine promoted the production of ROS and MDA, and reduced total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC); these effects were attenuated by midazolam.

Method(s): PC-12 cells were pre-treated with Sappanone A and were simulated by hypoxia. miRNA transfection was performed to overexpress or suppress the expression of miR-15a in PC-12 cells. Cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and expression levels of miR-15a were tested to evaluate the in vitro impact of Sappanone A on hypoxia-injured PC-12 cells. Result(s): Hypoxia exposure induced a significant damage in PC-12 cells, as evidenced by the repressed cell growth, the induced apoptosis and the impaired migrating capacity. Sappanone A pretreatment protected PC-12 cells against hypoxia-mediated cell damage. More interestingly, Sappanone A treatment down-regulated miR-15a, and the neuroprotective effects of Sappanone A were attenuated by miR-15a overexpression while were accelerated by miR-15a suppression. Finally, Sappanone A significantly activated Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. And the activation of these two signaling induced by Sappanone A were repressed by miR-15a overexpression and were enhanced by miR-15a suppression. Conclusion(s): Sappanone A exerted protective activity in PC-12 cells which were stimulated by hypoxia. One of the possible mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect is that: Sappanone A down-regulated the expression of miR-15a, and thus activated Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.

The purpose of the study was to screen and identify bioactive compounds from BHD using live PC12 cells coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Using this approach, we successfully identified six bioactive components from BHD. These components have protective effects on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury to PC12 cells. Furthermore, calycosin-7-d-glucoside (CG) and formononetin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside (FG) could upregulate the protein expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

Ginsenosides have been identified as the principle active ingredients for Panax ginsengs biological activity, among which ginsenoside Rd (Rd) attracts extensive attention for its obvious neuroprotective activities. Here we investigated the effect of Rd on neurite outgrowth, a crucial process associated with neuronal repair. PC12 cells, which respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) and serve as a model for neuronal cells, were treated with different concentrations of Rd, and then their neurite outgrowth was evaluated. Our results showed that 10 muM Rd significantly increased the percentages of long neurite- and branching neurite-bearing cells, compared with respective controls. The length of the longest neurites and the total length of neurites in Rd-treated PC12 cells were much longer than that of respective controls. We also showed that Rd activated ERK1/2 and AKT but not PKC signalings, and inhibition of ERK1/2 by PD98059 or/and AKT by LY294002 effectively attenuated Rd-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, Rd upregulated the expression of GAP-43, a neuron-specific protein involved in neurite outgrowth, while PD98059 or/and LY294002 decreased Rd-induced increased GAP-43 expression. Taken together, our results provided the first evidence that Rd may promote the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells by upregulating GAP-43 expression via ERK- and ARK-dependent signaling pathways.

PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy removes damaged mitochondria under various pathological conditions. The objective of this study was to determine mitophagy status and its effects on mitochondrial function and neuronal cell damage after cisplatin treatment using an in vitro model of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Material/Methods: PC12 cells were transfected with Parkin or Parkin siRNA using lentiviral particles and Lipofectamine 3000TM, respectively, and then were exposed to 10 muM cisplatin. The expression of autophagic proteins was measured by Western blot analysis. Mitophagy in PC12 cells was detected by confocal microscopy analysis of mitochondria-lysosomes colocalization and autophagic flux. The effects of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy on cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity were assessed via mitochondrial function, neuritic length, nuclear diameter, and apoptosis. Result(s): Cisplatin activated PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in PC12 cells. Autophagic flux analysis revealed that cisplatin inhibits the late stage of the autophagic process. The knockdown of Parkin suppressed cisplatin-induced mitophagy, aggravating cisplatin-induced depolarization of mitochondria, cellular ATP deficits, reactive oxygen species outburst, neuritic shortening, nuclear diameter reduction, and apoptosis, while Parkin overexpression enhanced mitophagy and reversed these effects. Conclusion(s): PINK1/Parkin-regulated mitophagy can protect against cisplatin-related neurotoxicity, suggesting therapeutic enhancement of mitophagy as a potential intervention for cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathies. The interference of cisplatin with autophagosome-lysosome fusion may be partly responsible for cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity.Copyright © Med Sci Monit, 2019","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Allicin, the main biologically active compound derived from garlic, has been shown to exert various anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic activities in in vitro and in vivo studies. Methods: The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective role of allicin in an in vitro PD model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in PC12 cells. The protective effects were measured by cell viability, decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and flow cytometry, and the anti-oxidative activity was determined by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, lipid peroxidation and the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. Mitochondrial function in PC12 cells was detected by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and the mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity. To investigate the potential mechanism, we also measured the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis factors, mitochondrial morphological dynamic changes, as well as detected mitochondrial dynamic proteins by western blot. Results: We found that allicin treatment significant increased cell viability, and decreased LDH release and apoptotic cell death after 6-OHDA exposure. Allicin also inhibited ROS generation, reduced lipid peroxidation and preserved the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. These protective effects were associated with suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by decreased MMP collapse and cytochrome c release, preserved mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and the promotion of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity. In addition, allicin significantly enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and prevented fragmentation of mitochondrial network after 6-OHDA treatment. The results of western blot analysis showed that the 6-OHDA induced decrease in the expression of optic atrophy type 1 (Opa-1), increase in mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis-1) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) were all partially revised by allicin. Conclusion: In summary, our data strongly suggested that allicin treatment can exert protective effects against PD related neuronal injury through inhibiting oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction with dynamic changes.

Hypoxia increased [Ca2+](i) and exaggerated its response to K+ depolarization in both parts of the cells. [Ca2+](i) in the cell bodies was greater than that in the growth cones under resting conditions and in response to K+ or hypoxia. Ca2+-channel blockers selectively altered these responses. The L-channel blocker nifedipine reduced [Ca2+](i) following K+ depolarization by 67% in the cell bodies but only 25% in the growth cones. In contrast, the N-channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX) diminished K+-induced changes in [Ca2+](i) only in the growth cones. During hypoxia, nifedipine was more effective in the cell bodies than in the growth cones. During hypoxia, omega- CgTX diminished K+induced changes by 50-75% in both parts of the cell, but only immediately after depolarization. The combination of nifedipine and omega- CgTX diminished the [Ca2+](i) response to K+ with or without hypoxia by >90% in the cell body and 70% in the growth cones. Thus, the increased Ca2+ entry with K+ during hypoxia is primarily through L channels in the cell bodies, whereas in growth cones influx through L and N channels is about equal. The results show that chemical hypoxia selectively alters Ca2+ regulation in the growth cone and cell body of the same cell.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

It has numerous bioactivities and has been used to treat hepatitis in China. However, few studies have reported its effect on the central nervous system, especially in ischemic stroke. Objective: To explore the protective effects of OA on cerebral ischemic injury for the first time. Materials and methods: Survival time was tested in mice injured by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCCAL). Neurological function, infarct area, cerebral edema, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were estimated in rats operated by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Cell survival, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), SOD, reduced glutathione (GSH), MDA, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) were detected in H2O2-injured PC12 cells. Results: Pre-administration with OA significantly prolonged survival time in mice at 50 and 25mg/kg, alleviated neurological function, infarct area and cerebral edema, increased SOD and GSH-Px activities and decreased MDA level in rats at 25 and 12.5mg/kg. Pre-treatment with OA at 10 and 1 muM remarkably improved cell survival, enhanced SOD activity and GSH content, reduced LDH and MDA levels and reversed the lowering of MMP and SDH activity. Discussion and conclusion: These results demonstrate that oleanolic acid effectively alleviates cerebral ischemic damage in vivo and oxidative injury in vitro, which may be in part due to the modulation of endogenous antioxidants and the improvement of mitochondrial function.

However, the precise mechanism of Dex-exerted neuroprotection is not clear. Increased neuronal NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) contributes to oxidative stress and neuronal damage in various hypoxia-related neurodegenerative disorders. The present study investigated whether Dex regulated neuronal NOX2 to exert its protective effects under hypoxic conditions. Well-differentiated PC12 cells were exposed to cobalt chloride (CoCl2) to mimic a neuronal model of chemical hypoxia-mediated neurotoxicity. The data showed that Dex pretreatment of PC12 cells significantly suppressed CoCl2-induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by the enhanced cell viability, restoration of cellular morphology, and reduction in apoptotic cells. Dex improved mitochondrial function and inhibited CoCl2-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. We further demonstrated that Dex attenuated oxidative stress, downregulated NOX2 protein expression and activity, and inhibited intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) overload in CoCl2-treated PC12 cells. Moreover, knockdown of the NOX2 gene markedly improved mitochondrial function and attenuated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. These results demonstrated that the protective effects of Dex against hypoxia-induced neurotoxicity in neural cells were mediated, at least partially, via inhibition of NOX2-mediated oxidative stress.

Seven day-culture with D-glucose (9.0-27.0 mg/ml as 2-6-fold of the optimal level) induced cell death in a dose-related manner but 3-day culture with high concentrations of glucose had no effect on cell viability. L-glucose had no effect on viability of PC12 cells, suggesting that D-glucose toxicity was independent of its osmolarity effect. Seven-day culture with D-glucose (13.5 mg/ml as 3-fold of the optimal level) increased nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) in the culture medium. Glucose-induced increase in NOx was eliminated by 0.1 mM L-nitro-arginine methylester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased by D-glucose in a dose-related manner, suggesting that D-glucose activated NOS by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration in PC12 cells. Glucose-induced cell death was blunted by 0.1 mM L-NAME, showing that nitric oxide (NO) was involved in the glucose toxicity to PC12 cells. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor for NOS, attenuated both glucose-induced cell death and NOx production at 1 muM but not at 10 muM. The effects of BH4 on glucose-induced cell death and NOx production were not mimicked by reducing agents such as ascorbate and cysteine. These results taken together suggest that high concentrations of glucose induced cell death via NO production and that low concentration of BH4 had a protective effect against glucose neurotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), a major active chemical component isolated from Carthamus tinctorius L., has been shown to possess neuroprotective actions in various ischemic models in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective effect of HSYA against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The PC12 cells were pretreated with different concentrations (20, 40 and 80 muM) of HSYA for 2 h and then further treated with Abeta (20 muM) for 24 h. The results showed that Abeta could significantly decrease cell viability, glutathione level, mitochondrial membrane potential and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression, while elevate the release of lactate dehydrogenase, the formation of DNA fragmentation, the levels of malondialdehyde and intracellular reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells. However, pretreatment with HSYA could effectively reverse these changes induced by Abeta in PC12 cells.

Results: Our data show that LPS is able to induce PC12 neuronal cell death without the participation of glial cells. Neuronal cell death was mediated by an increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Considering the prevalent role of specific ion channels in mediating the deleterious effect of ROS, we assessed their contribution to this process. Neurons exposed to LPS showed a significant intracellular Ca2+ overload, and nonselective cationic channel blockers inhibited LPS-induced neuronal death. In particular, we observed that both LPS and hydrogen peroxide exposure strongly increased the expression of the transient receptor protein melastatin 7 (TRPM7), which is an ion channel directly implicated in neuronal cell death. Further, both LPS-induced TRPM7 overexpression and LPS-induced neuronal cell death were decreased with dithiothreitol, dipheniliodonium, and apocynin. Finally, knockdown of TRPM7 expression using small interference RNA technology protected primary hippocampal neurons and differentiated PC12 neurons from the LPS challenge. Innovation: This is the first report showing that TRPM7 is a key protein involved in neuronal death after LPS challenge.

The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been shown to have therapeutic potential in some central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including ischemic injury. In this study, we demonstrate that bFGF administration can improve locomotor activity and inhibit the ER stress induced in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in a mouse model of I/R injury. In vitro, bFGF exerts a protective effect by inhibiting the ER stress response proteins CHOP, XBP-1, ATF-6 and caspase-12 that are induced by H2O2 treatment. Both of these in vivo and in vitro effects are related to the activation of two downstream signaling pathways, PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways by specific inhibitors, LY294002 and U0126, respectively, partially reduce the protective effect of bFGF.

At the same time, these cells demonstrated exacerbated cell death when subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) together with high substrate concentrations, indicating that H2S production has a detrimental effect on cell survival. This effect could be abolished by CBS inhibition. The same effect was observed with primary astrocytes exposed to OGD and high substrates or sodium hydrosulfide. In addition, CBS was upregulated and activated by truncation in primary astrocytes subjected to OGD. When rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, CBS activation was also observed.

Our previous experiments have demonstrated the cognition restoring effect of noopept in several animal models of Alzheimer disease (AD). Noopept was also shown to prevent ionic disbalance, excitotoxicity, free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines accumulation, and neurotrophine deficit typical for different kinds of brain damages, including AD. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective action of noopept on cellular model of AD, Abeta25-35-induced toxicity in PC12 cells and revealed the underlying mechanisms. Results: The neuroprotective effect of noopept (added to the medium at 10 muM concentration, 72 hours before beta25-35) was studied on beta25-35-induced injury (5 muM for 24 h) in PC12 cells. The ability of drug to protect the impairments of cell viability, calcium homeostasis, ROS level, mitochondrial function, tau phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth caused by beta25-35were evaluated. Following the exposure of PC12 cells to beta25-35an increase of the level of ROS, intracellular calcium, and tau phosphorylation at Ser396 were observed; these changes were accompanied by a decrease in cell viability and an increase of apoptosis. Noopept treatment before the amyloid-beta exposure improved PC12 cells viability, reduced the number of early and late apoptotic cells, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and calcium and enhanced the mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, pretreatment of PC12 cell with noopept significantly attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser396 and ameliorated the alterations of neurite outgrowth evoked by beta25-35. Conclusions: Taken together, these data provide evidence that novel cognitive enhancer noopept protects PC12 cell against deleterious actions of Abeta through inhibiting the oxidative damage and calcium overload as well as suppressing the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Moreover, neuroprotective properties of noopept likely include its ability to decrease tau phosphorylation and to restore the altered morphology of PC12 cells. Therefore, this nootropic dipeptide is able to positively affect not only common pathogenic pathways but also disease-specific mechanisms underlying Abeta-related pathology.

The present study was designed to examine the role of IMM-H004, a derivative of coumarin, in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced HT. Rats subjected to 6 h of thromboembolic occlusion or middle cerebral artery occlusion received tPA with or without IMM-H004. Delayed tPA intervention drastically increased the risk of HT and exaggerated the ischemic injury. To assess the effect of IMM-H004 on delayed treatment of tPA-induced toxicity after ischemia and reperfusion, various approaches were used, including a behavior test, TTC-staining, determination of cerebral hemorrhage, laser speckle imaging, Western blot, gelatin zymogram, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. Experiments were also conducted in vitro in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and PC12 cells to explore the mechanism for the role of IMM-H004. Combination therapy of tPA and IMM-H004 prevented the development of HT, and reduced the mortality rate, infarct volume and brain edema. IMM-H004 also exerted a protective role by decreasing matrix metalloproteinases, the co-localization of matrix metalloproteinase-2 with astrocytes and increasing occludin.

However, the mechanism of glutamate-induced injury remains elusive. Gastrodin, a major active component of the traditional herbal agent Gastrodia elata (GE) Blume, has been recognized as a potential neuroprotective drug. In the current study, a classical injury model based on glutamate-induced cell death of rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells was used to investigate the neuroprotective effect of gastrodin, and its potential mechanisms involved. In this paper, the presence of gastrodin inhibits glutamate-induced oxidative stress as measured by the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and superoxide dismutase (SOD); gastrodin also prevents glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i influx, blocks the activation of the calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the apoptosis signaling-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), inhibits phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK). Additionally, gastrodin blocked the expression of p53 phosphorylation, caspase-3 and cytochrome C, reduced bax/bcl-2 ratio induced by glutamate in PC12 cells. All these findings indicate that gastrodin protects PC12 cells from the apoptosis induced by glutamate through a new mechanism of the CaMKII/ASK-1/p38 MAPK/p53-signaling pathway. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"
"bd132644-aca1-4287-a8f8-9aaedaca5d14","Physiology and pharmacology of natural and synthetic nonadenine-based purines in the nervous system","Like their adenine-based counterparts, increasing evidence implicates extracellular nonadenine-based purines such as guanosine and GTP as trophic effector molecules, affecting the growth and differentiation of cells in the nervous system. The extracellular concentration of guanosine is higher than that of adenosine, both in physiological and pathological conditions. Extracellular guanosine and GTP stimulate the astrocyte cell division, apparently through enhancing release of their adenine-based counterparts, which act in an autocrine fashion. Guanosine and GTP also stimulate the synthesis by astrocytes of several neurotrophic factors, e.g., NGF, and bFGF, and the release of NGF and S100beta. As well, guanosine and GTP enhance the differentiation of PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons in vitro. Their action on PC12 cells is associated with the early synthesis of adenotin-1, a chaperone protein. A hypoxanthine analog, AIT-082, has similar activity on PC12 cells and neurons to guanosine, but is not metabolized. It enhances memory in both old memory-deficient mice and in young mice, stimulates neurotrophic factor synthesis in astrocytes in vitro and in brain in vivo, and protects hippocampal neurons in vitro from a dying-back neuropathy caused by brief exposure to high concentrations of glutamate. Given systemically, it protects neurons from NMDA-induced toxicity. Its neuroprotective effects may partly be related to its ability to stimulate release of NGF from astrocytes. Although AIT-082 enhances NGF synthesis, unlike exogenously administered NGF it does not produce hyperalgesia. AIT- 082 may prove useful in the treatment of Alzheimers disease, for which it is in Phase II trials, and also in the treatment of acute neuronal injuries due, e.g., to trauma and stroke.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,5,"Excluded"

Salidroside is a phenylpropanoid glycoside isolated from Rhodiola rosea L., a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, and has displayed a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties. In this study, MTT assay, Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry with annexin V/PI staining collectively showed that pretreatment with salidroside attenuated, in a dose-dependent manner, cell viability loss, and apoptotic cell death in cultured PC12 cells induced by hypoglycemia and serum limitation. RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and enzymatic colorimetric assay indicated the changes in expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase3 in PC12 cells on exposure to hypoglycemia and serum limitation with and without salidroside pretreatment, respectively. Rhodamine 123 staining and flow cytometry with 2,7- Dichlorofluorescin diacetate staining revealed the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and radical oxygen species (ROS) production in PC12 cells on exposure to hypoglycemia and serum limitation with and without salidroside pretreatment, respectively. The experimental results suggest that salidroside protects the PC12 cells against hypoglycemia and serum limitation-induced cytotoxicity possibly by the way of the modulation of apoptosis-related gene expression, the restoration of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the inhibition of the intracellular ROS production.

Vitamin K2 acts as a cofactor in many biochemical pathways, including sphingolipid synthesis in the nervous system, which is involved in many cellular events, including proliferation, differentiation, cellular communication, and alteration. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of vitamin K2 in PC12 cells as an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease. The protective effects of vitamin K2 against 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells were assessed using resazurin for viability, DCF-DA for ROS level, DTNB for glutathione level, flow cytometry for sub G1, and western blot analysis for detecting bax and pro-caspase-3 expression level. The results showed that 6-OHDA significantly decreased cell viability, glutathione and pro-caspase-3 levels, and increased ROS, the amount of bax in PC12 cells, while the pretreatment with 5 muM vitamin K2 significantly decreased the cell death induced by 6-OHDA. Generally, the results may present a new insight about the potential protective action of vitamin K2 against the progression of Parkinson's disease. Further studies may warrant the use of vitamin K2 as an antioxidant and anti-apoptotic agent in slowing nerve injury in neurodegenerative disease, particularly in Parkinson's disease.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,2,"Excluded"

In present study, we adopted the oxygen glucose/reperfusion model in PC12 cells, bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model in C57B6 mice and middle cerebral artery occlusion model in SD rats to observe the therapeutic effects of APG on ischemic stroke. We also discussed the underlying mechanism. Treatment with 0.4 mug/ml or 0.8 mug/ml APG promoted cell viability and proliferation, reduced LDH release and apoptotic cell death levels in PC12 cells. Treatment with 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg APG at 30 minutes after reperfusion improved neurological outcomes in vivo, as demonstrated by elevation of neurological scores in both mice and rats. It also increased the number of survival neurons in mice and reduced infarct volume in rats.

Adaptation to ER stress depends on the activation of a signal transduction pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Enhanced expression of Hsp72 has been shown to reduce tissue injury in response to stress stimuli and improve cell survival in experimental models of stroke, sepsis, renal failure, and myocardial ischemia. Hsp72 inhibits several features of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms by which Hsp72 expression inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis are not clearly understood. Here we show that Hsp72 enhances cell survival under ER stress conditions. The UPR signals through the sensor IRE1alpha, which controls the splicing of the mRNA encoding the transcription factor XBP1. We show that Hsp72 enhances XBP1 mRNA splicing and expression of its target genes, associated with attenuated apoptosis under ER stress conditions. Inhibition of XBP1 mRNA splicing either by dominant negative IRE1alpha or by knocking down XBP1 specifically abrogated the inhibition of ER stress-induced apoptosis by Hsp72. Regulation of the UPR was associated with the formation of a stable protein complex between Hsp72 and the cytosolic domain of IRE1alpha. Finally, Hsp72 enhanced the RNase activity of recombinant IRE1alpha in vitro, suggesting a direct regulation. Our data show that binding of Hsp72 to IRE1alpha enhances IRE1alpha/XBP1 signaling at the ER and inhibits ER stress-induced apoptosis.

It has been approved that mitochondria play a key role in PC mechanism. The critical role of complex I (CI) in oxidative phosphorylation machinery and intracellular ROS production, particularly in the brain, accentuates its possible role in PC-induced neuroprotection. Here, differentiated PC12 cells were preconditioned with ultra-low dose LPS (ULD, 3 mug/mL) prior to exposure to high concentration of LPS (HD, 750 mug/mL). Our results showed that HD LPS treatment reduces cell viability and CI activity, and intensifies expression of cleaved caspase 3 compared to the control group. Intriguingly, PC induction resulted in enhancement of cell viability and CI activity and reduction of caspase3 cleavage compared to HD LPS group. In order to explore the role of CI in PC, we combined the ULD LPS with rotenone, a CI inhibitor. Following rotenone administration, cell viability significantly reduced while caspase3 cleavage increased compared to PC induction group. Taken together, cell survival and reduction of apoptosis followed by PC can be at least partially attributed to the preservation of mitochondrial CI function.Copyright © 2019, Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research.

Transgenic Drosophila mutants with A beta -induced neurodegeneration in pan-neuron and ommatidia were used to determine the efficacy of GE. The antiapoptotic and antioxidative mechanisms of GE were also studied in A beta -treated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. In vivo studies demonstrated that GE (5 mg/g Drosophila media)-treated Drosophila possessed a longer lifespan, better locomotor function, and less-degenerated ommatidia when compared with the A beta -expressing control (all P < 0.05). In vitro studies illustrated that GE increased the cell viability of A beta -treated PC12 cells in dose-dependent manner, probably through attenuation of A beta -induced oxidative and apoptotic stress. GE also significantly upregulated the enzymatic activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, leading to the decrease of reactive oxidation species production and apoptotic marker caspase-3 activity. In conclusion, our current data presented the first evidence that the aqueous extract of GE was capable of reducing the A beta -induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila, possibly through inhibition of apoptosis and reduction of oxidative stress.

In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective properties of CP and their potential mechanisms on brain ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, and on oxidative stress-induced damage in PC12 cells. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with ischemia following middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion were investigated. CP (200 mg/kg) significantly decreased the neurological deficit score, reduced infarct volume, decreased neuronal loss in cerebral cortex, and remarkably reduced the protein synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase which were induced by ischemia and reperfusion. Otherwise, the protective effect of CP was confirmed in in vitro study. CP protected PC12 cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) insult. Pretreatment with CP prior to H2O2 exposure significantly elevated cell viability, reduced H2O2-induced apoptosis, and decreased both intracellular and total accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, CP also reversed the upregulation of Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA ratio, the downstream cascade following ROS.

In excitotoxicity glutamate triggers the rise of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, followed by up regulation of nNOS, dysfunction of mitochondria, ROS production, ER stress, and release of lysosomal enzymes. Excessive calcium concentration is the key mediator of glutamate toxicity through over activation of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. In addition, glutamate accumulation can also inhibit cystine (CySS) uptake by reversing the action of the CySS/glutamate antiporter. Reversal of the antiporter action reinforces the aforementioned events by depleting neurons of cysteine and eventually glutathiones reducing potential. Various cell lines have been employed in the pursuit to understand the mechanism(s) by which excitotoxicity affects the cells leading them ultimately to their demise. In some cell lines glutamate toxicity is exerted mainly through over activation of NMDA, AMPA, or kainate receptors whereas in other cell lines lacking such receptors, the toxicity is due to glutamate induced oxidative stress. However, in the greatest majority of the cell lines ionotropic glutamate receptors are present, co-existing to CySS/glutamate antiporters and metabotropic glutamate receptors, supporting the assumption that excitotoxicity effect in these cells is accumulative. Different cell lines differ in their responses when exposed to glutamate.

Autophagy is a self-degradative process and plays a critical role in removing long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Recent evidence suggests that autophagy might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. beta-asarone have various neuroprotective effects. However, the effect of beta-asarone on autophagy in amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) induced cell injury is unclear, and little is known about the signaling pathway of beta-asarone in autophagy regulation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether beta-asarone protects cells from Abeta1-42 induced cytotoxicity via regulation of Beclin-1 dependent autophagy and its regulating signaling pathway. We examined effects of beta-asarone on cell morphology, cell viability, neuron specific enolase (NSE) levels, autophagosomes and regulating Beclin-1, p-Akt and p-mTOR expressions in Abeta1-42 treated PC12 cells. We found that beta-asarone could maintain the original morphology of cells and increase cell viability and decrease NSE levels significantly. Meanwhile, beta-asarone decreased Beclin-1 expression significantly. In addition, beta-asarone can increase levels of p-Akt and p-mTOR. These results showed that beta-asarone protected cells from Abeta1-42 induced cytotoxicity and attenuated autophagy via activation of Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which could be involved in neuroprotection of beta-asarone against Abeta toxicity.

The present study was designed to explore the protective effects of eriodictyol against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced neurotoxicity with cultured rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) and the possible mechanisms involved. For this purpose, differentiated PC12 cells were cultured and exposed to 200 muM H(2)O(2) in the absence or presence of eriodictyol (20, 40 and 80 muM). In addition, the potential contribution of the Nrf2/ARE neuroprotective pathway in eriodictyol-mediated protection against H(2)O(2)-induced neurotoxicity was also investigated. The results showed that H(2)O(2)-induced cell death can be inhibited in the presence of eriodictyol as measured by assays for MTT and apoptosis. Further study revealed that eriodictyol induced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, enhanced the expression of heme oxygenase (HO-1) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), and increased the levels of intracellular glutathione. Treatment of PC12 cells with Nrf2 small interference RNA abolished eriodictyol-induced HO-1 and gamma-GCS expression and its protective effects.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) alpha-AA is a more stable mutant form of HIF-1alpha, which is a crucial oxygen-sensitive regulator. To investigate the protective effects of HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs on neuron survival in cerebral ischemia models, we co-cultured HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs with neuron-like cells (PC12 cells) and observed a significant increase in the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from BMSCs, the decreased PC12 cell apoptosis, and the upregulation of Survivin expression reduced by hypoxia in PC12 cells compared to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) BMSCs. In addition, to explore whether VEGF secreted by HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs plays an important role in preventing hypoxia-induced apoptosis and the possible mechanism involved, exogenous VEGF were applied and the similar protective effects on PC12 cells were observed in vitro. Furthermore, hypoxia reduced the expression of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated FoxO1, whereas the administration of VEGF reversed these changes. Transfection of FoxO1 H215R, a DNA-binding mutant, abrogated the inhibitory ability on Survivin promoter activity, whereas FoxO1 AAA, the active form of FoxO1, presented further repression on Survivin promoter, indicating that FoxO1 directly binds on Survivin promoter as a transcriptional repressor and that phosphorylation status of FoxO1 affects its inhibition on the Survivin promoter. Transplantation of HIF-1alpha-AA-modified BMSCs after cerebral ischemia in vivo sufficiently reduced neurons apoptosis, decreased cerebral infarction volume, and induced a significant improvement on the modified neurological severity score compared to the EGFP BMSCs group.

Here, we investigated three different treatment ways of CB and FE. It was interesting that post-treatment of CB and FE (restoring way) showed similar effect to the preventive way, while attenuating way did not show any protective effect.

We report that the extracellular-dependent early increase (30 min) in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), following Abeta(1-42) exposure, caused the activation of calpain that in turn elicited a cleavage of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger isoform NCX3. This cleavage generated a hyperfunctional form of the antiporter and increased NCX currents (I(NCX)) in the reverse mode of operation. Interestingly, this NCX3 calpain-dependent cleavage was essential for the Abeta(1-42)-dependent I(NCX) increase. Indeed, the calpain inhibitor calpeptin and the removal of the calpain-cleavage recognition sequence, via site-directed mutagenesis, abolished this effect. Moreover, the enhanced NCX3 activity was paralleled by an increased Ca(2+) content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Remarkably, the silencing in PC-12 cells or the knocking-out in mice of the ncx3 gene prevented the enhancement of both I(NCX) and Ca(2+) content in ER stores, suggesting that NCX3 was involved in the increase of ER Ca(2+) content stimulated by Abeta(1-42). By contrast, in the late phase (72 h), when the NCX3 proteolytic cleavage abruptly ceased, the occurrence of a parallel reduction in ER Ca(2+) content triggered ER stress, as revealed by caspase-12 activation. Concomitantly, the late increase in [Ca(2+)](i) coincided with neuronal death. Interestingly, NCX3 silencing caused an earlier activation of Abeta(1-42)-induced caspase-12. Indeed, in NCX3-silenced neurons, Abeta(1-42) exposure hastened caspase-dependent apoptosis, thus reinforcing neuronal cell death. These results suggest that Abeta(1-42), through Ca(2+)-dependent calpain activation, generates a hyperfunctional form of NCX3 that, by increasing Ca(2+) content into ER, delays caspase-12 activation and thus neuronal death.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,4,"Excluded"

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of ICA on AGE-induced injury in PC12 cells. Our findings revealed that ICA could effectively protect PC12 cells from AGE-induced cell apoptosis by suppressing oxidative stress. Moreover, we observed that ICA could significantly protect against mitochondrial depolarization following AGE stimulation and inactivate the mitochondria-dependent caspase-9/3 apoptosis pathway. Most notably, we identified the direct target protein of ICA as apoptosis regulator Bax by a pulldown assay. We found that ICA could specifically target Bax protein and inhibit Bax dimer formation and migration to mitochondria. Furthermore, a siRNA knockdown experiment revealed that ICA could inhibit PC12 cell apoptosis and oxidative stress through targeting Bax. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that ICA could attenuate AGE-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptosis by specifically targeting Bax and further regulating the biological function of Bax on mitochondria.Copyright © 2019 Shao-Yang Zhao et al.

We previously demonstrated that HI significantly increased microRNA-210 (miR-210) in the neonatal rat brain and inhibition of brain endogenous miR-210 was neuroprotective in HI brain injury. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning this neuroprotection remain unclear. Using both in vivo and in vitro models, herein we uncover a novel mechanism mediating oxidative brain injury after neonatal HI, in which miR-210 induces mitochondrial dysfunction via downregulation of iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein (ISCU). Inhibition of miR-210 significantly ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss in the neonatal brain subjected to HI, as well as in primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). These effects are mediated through ISCU, in that miR-210 mimic decreases ISCU abundance in the brains of rat pups and primary cortical neurons, and inhibition of miR-210 protects ISCU against HI in vivo or OGD in vitro. Deletion of miR-210 binding sequences at the 3UTR of ISCU transcript ablates miR-210-induced downregulation of ISCU protein abundance in PC12 cells. In primary cortical neurons, miR-210 mimic or silencing ISCU results in mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species production, and activation of caspase-dependent death pathways.

Aripiprazole presumably activates a system that concurrently detoxifies reactive oxygen species and replenishes NADPH. Nrf2, a master transcriptional regulator of redox homeostasis genes, also activates the pentose phosphate pathway, including NADPH production. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether aripiprazole activates Nrf2 in PC12 cells. Aripiprazole increased mRNA expression of Nrf2-dependent genes (NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase-1, Nqo1; heme oxygenase-1, HO1; and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit) and protein expression of Nqo1 and HO1 in these cells (p < 0.05). To maintain increased Nrf2 activity, it is necessary to inhibit Nrf2 degradation; this is done by causing Nrf2 to dissociate from Keap1 or beta-TrCP. However, in aripiprazole-treated cells, the relative amount of Nrf2 anchored to Keap1 or beta-TrCP was unaffected and Nrf2 in the nuclear fraction decreased (p < 0.05). Aripiprazole did not affect phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser40 and decreased the relative amount of acetylated Nrf2 (p < 0.05). The increase in Nqo1 and HO1 in aripiprazole-treated cells cannot be explained by the canonical Nrf2-degrading pathways. Further experiments are needed to determine the biochemical mechanisms underlying the aripiprazole-induced increase in these enzymes.

Pretreatment with the Nrf2 inducer, 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), significantly increases the Nrf2 protein levels and prevents apoptosis in ethanol-exposed embryos. The present study, using PC12 cells, was designed to determine whether increased Nrf2 stability is a mechanism by which D3T enhances Nrf2 activation and subsequent antioxidant protection. Ethanol and D3T treatment resulted in a significant accumulation of Nrf2 protein in PC 12 cells. CHX chase analysis has shown that ethanol treatment delayed the degradation of Nrf2 protein in PC12 cells. A significantly greater decrease in Nrf2 protein degradation was observed in the cells treated with D3T alone or with both ethanol and D3T. In addition, D3T treatment significantly reduced ethanol-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the stabilization of Nrf2 protein by D3T confers protection against ethanol-induced apoptosis.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Here, taking Yindan Xinnaotong soft capsule (YDXNT), a TCMs preparation composed by 8 herbs, as a case, a strategy that integrated multiple chromatographic analysis and bioactivity assay was proposed for potential ECCs of neuroprotection discovery. Firstly, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were applied for comprehensive profiling of the chemical constituents in YDXNT. Given the fact that the complex matrix interference makes it more difficult to identify potentially active compounds, we proposed a structure-diagnostic ions-oriented strategy to remove interference ions from the raw UHPLC-MS data. The proposed strategy consisted of different filtering methods, including diagnostic fragment ions filtering (DFIF), mass defect filtering (MDF) and neutral loss (NL). Using this strategy, a total of 124 compounds were rapidly identified. Among them, 62 non-volatile and 5 volatile constituents in 30 batches of YDXNT were quantified by UHPLC tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QQQ-MS) and GC-MS methods, respectively. In order to facilitate the quality control of YDXNT, candidate ECCs were selected based on the threshold setting of absolute -contents, and their neuroprotective effects were examined. Finally, a combination of 16 compounds, accounts for 2.80% (w/w) of original YDXNT, was identified as its potential ECCs, which could be considered for the improvement of quality standardization of YDXNT.Copyright © 2019","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,10,"Excluded"

Here, we report that following a 5-7-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) acetylation of histone H4 at residue K16 (H4K16Ac) decreases by 40-80% in both PC12 cells and primary neurons. This effect can be reverted by treatment with trichostatin A, or by supplementation with acetyl-CoA. A decrease in H4K16Ac levels can affect the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) and Notch-pathway genes in a cell-specific manner.

For this purpose, rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells were treated with MPP+ (1 mM) for 24 h following pretreatment with NBP (0.1 mM). Cell metabolic viability was determined by the MTT assay and cell ultrastructure was examined by transmission electron microscopy. The intracellular distribution and expression of a-synuclein and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) were detected by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Our results demonstrated that: 1) NBP prevented MPP+-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells by promoting metabolic viability. 2) NBP induced the accumulation of autophagosomes in MPP+-treated PC12 cells. 3) Further study of the molecular mechanism demonstrated that NBP enhanced the colocalization of alpha-synuclein and LC3 and up-regulated the protein level of LC3-II. These results demonstrate that NBP protects PC12 cells against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity by activating autophagy-mediated a-synuclein degradation, implying that it may be a potential effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of PD.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

UPR results in induction of molecular chaperone GRP78 and the ER-resident caspase-12, whose activation has been proposed to be mediated by calpain and caspase processing, although their relative contribution remains unclear. In this study we induced ER stress with thapsigargin (TG), and determined the activation profile of calpain-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-12 by analyses of protein levels, corresponding substrates and breakdown products (BDP). Specific calpain and caspase activity was assessed by analysis of alphaII-spectrin BDP of 145 kDa (SBDP145), BDP of 150 kDa (SBDP150) and BDP of 120 kDa (SBDP120). Decrease in pro-calpain-2 protein and increased SBDP145 levels by 3 h after TG treatment indicated early calpain activity. Active caspase-7 (p20) increase occurred after 8 h, followed by concomitant up-regulation of active caspase-3 and SBDP120 after 24 h. In vitro digestion experiments supported that SBDP120 was exclusively generated by active caspase-3 and validated that kinectin and co-chaperone p23 were calpain and caspase-7 substrates, respectively. Pro-caspase-12 protein processing by the specific action of calpain and caspase-3/7 was observed in a time-dependent manner. N-terminal pro-domain processing of pro-caspase-12 by calpain generated a 38 kDa fragment, while caspase-3/7 generated a 35 kDa fragment. Antibody developed specifically against the caspase-3/7 C-terminal cleavage site D341 detected the presence of large subunit (p20) containing 23 kDa fragment that increased after 24 h of TG treatment. Significant caspase-12 enzyme activity was only detected after 24 h of TG treatment and was completely inhibited by caspase 3/7 inhibitor DEVD-fmk and partially by calpain inhibitor SNJ-1945. ER-stress-induced cell death pathway in TG-treated PC12 cells was characterized by up-regulation of GRP-78 and processing and activation of caspase-12 by the orchestrated proteolytic activity of calpain-2 and caspase-3/7. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of vitexin against isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity remain elusive. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate these mechanisms further. Sprague Dawley rats received 1.4% isoflurane in a 100% oxygen environment for 2 h. Human PC12 pheochromocytoma neurosecretory cells were exposed to 2% isoflurane for 12 h before they were treated with 1, 10 or 100 M vitexin for a further 24 h. Vitexin inhibited the isoflurane-induced cell cytotoxicity and weakened isoflurane-induced neuroinflammation and oxidative stress pathways in PC12 cells. In addition, treatment with vitexin suppressed isoflurane-induced caspase-3 activation and increased beta-secretase 1 levels in PC12 cells. Furthermore, vitexin treatment decreased the levels of isoflurane-induced cytosolic calcium and reactive oxygen species, and downregulated the expression of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) and glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B (NR2B) protein expression in isoflurane-treated PC12 cells.

We describe an excitation ratio-metric fluorescence biosensor based on human carbonic anhydrase II variants expressed in the mitochondrial matrix, permitting free zinc levels to be quantitatively imaged therein. We observed an average mitochondrial matrix free zinc concentration of 0.2pM in the PC12 rat pheochromacytoma cell culture line. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial free zinc levels were imaged in a cellular oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) model of ischemia/reperfusion. We observed a significant increase in mitochondrial zinc 1 h following 3 h OGD, at a time point when cytosolic zinc levels were depressed. Following the increase, mitochondrial zinc levels returned to physiological levels, while cytosolic zinc increased gradually over a 24 h time period in viable cells.

Using natural products with neuroprotective properties, such as green tea polyphenols, would be a highly useful complementary approach for inexpensive long-term treatment of these diseases. In this study, we used PC12(TrkB) cells which ectopically express TrkB, a high affinity receptor for BDNF. They differentiate and induce neurite outgrowth in response to BDNF. Using this model, we show for the first time that treatment with extremely low concentrations (<0.1 mug/ml) of unfractionated green tea polyphenols (GTPP) and low concentrations (<0.5 muM) of their active ingredient, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), potentiated the neuritogenic ability of a low concentration (2 ng/ml) of BDNF. A synergistic interaction was observed between GTPP constituents, where epigallocatechin and epicatechin, both individually lacking this activity, promoted the action of EGCG. GTPP-induced potentiation of BDNF action required the cell-surface associated 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) to which EGCG binds with high affinity. A cell-permeable catalase abolished GTPP/EGCG-induced potentiation of BDNF action, suggesting the possible involvement of H2O2 in the potentiation. Consistently, exogenous sublethal concentrations of H2O2, added as a bolus dose (5 muM) or more effectively through a steady-state generation (1 muM), potentiated BDNF action. Collectively, these results suggest that EGCG, dependent on 67LR and H2O2, potentiates the neuritogenic action of BDNF. Intriguingly, this effect requires only submicromolar concentrations of EGCG. This is significant as extremely low concentrations of polyphenols are believed to reach the brain after drinking green tea. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Ln-cRNAs were involved in ischemia/reperfusion injury. The present study aims to investigate whether lncRNA ROR can promote the cerebral hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in vitro, a cellular model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, through inhibiting the expression of miR-135a-5p or upregulating the expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect the lncRNA ROR expression in PC12 cells induced by H/R and verify the transfection effect. ROS, LDH, SOD and MDA levels were detected by respective kits. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry analysis respectively detected the cell viability and cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was to analyze the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase3). Immunofluorescent staining detected the ROCK1/2 expression. As a result, lncRNA ROR expression was increased in the PC12 cells induced by H/R. LncRNA ROR overexpression could aggravate injury of PC12 cells induced by H/R. And, lncRNA ROR overexpression could decrease viability and promote apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by H/R. In addition, miR-135a-5p was demonstrated to be a target of lncRNA ROR and lncRNA ROR improved H/R injury in PC12 cells by up-regulating the expression of miR-135a-5p via down-regulating ROCK1/2 expression. In conclusion, this study indicated that lncRNA ROR could promote the cerebral H/R injury by inhibiting the expression of miR-135a-5p or upregulating the expression of ROCK1/2.

Recently, dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been used as an adjunct for sedation, and was shown to exert dose-dependent neuroprotective effects during brain injury. However, the maximum safe dose of DEX is unclear, and its protective effects against lidocaine-related neurotoxicity need to be confirmed. In this study, PC12 and NG108-15 cells were used to estimate safe, non-cytotoxic doses of DEX. We found that 100 and 60 muM are the maximum safe dose of DEX for PC12 and NG108-15 cells, respectively, with no significant cytotoxicity. Lidocaine was found to remarkably inhibit cell vitality, but could be reversed by different doses of DEX, especially its maximum safe dose. Furthermore, the apoptosis induced by lidocaine was also assessed, and 100 and 60 muM DEX showed optimal protective effects in PC12 and NG108-15 cells, respectively. Mechanistically, DEX activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, impaired caspase-3 expression, and enhanced anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 to resist lidocaine-induced apoptosis, indicating that the optimal dose of DEX alleviates lidocaine-induced cytotoxicity and should be considered in clinical application.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptotic and autophagic cell death is implicated in a wide range of diseases, including cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases. Thapsigargin was used to induce PC12 cell death, and Activin A was used for intervention. Our results showed that Activin A significantly inhibited morphological changes in thapsigargin-induced apoptotic cells, and the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins [cleaved-caspase-12, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved-caspase-3] and biomarkers of autophagy (Beclin-1 and light chain 3), and downregulated the expression of thapsigargin-induced ER stress-associated proteins [inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38].

Increasing evidence indicates that hydrogen sulphide (H2S) may serve as an important biological cytoprotective agent. Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 can attenuate stress-induced injury. However, whether Hsp90 mediates the cytoprotective effect of H2S against chemical hypoxia-induced injury in PC12 cells is not known.2. In the present study, CoCl2 (a chemical hypoxia mimetic) was used to treat PC12 cells to create a model of chemical hypoxia. To explore the role of Hsp90 in the cytoprotection afforded by H2S against chemical hypoxia-induced injury, 2 mumol/L 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), a selective inhibitor of Hsp90, was administered for 30 min prior to preconditioning with 400 mumol/L NaHS, followed by chemical hypoxia.3. Cobalt chloride reduced cell viability (by 52.7 +/- 1.5%), increased PC12 cell apoptosis (by 42.1 +/- 1.5%), induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 3.79% compared with control and induced the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 2.56% compared with control.4. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with 100-400 mumol/L sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS), an H2S donor, for 3 h prior to exposure to 600 mumol/L CoCl2 provided significant, concentration-dependant protection to PC12 cells against CoCl2-induced cytotoxicity. Specifically, pretreatment of PC12 cells with 400 mumol/L NaHS decreased apoptosis to 16.77 +/- 1.77% and blocked the CoCl2-induced increase in ROS production and loss of MMP.5. At 400 mumol/L, NaHS upregulated Hsp90 in a time-dependant manner (over the period 0-180 min). In addition to its effects on Hsp90 expression, NaHS pretreatment of PC12 cells augmented the overexpression of Hsp90 induced by 600 mumol/L CoCl2 by 1.38-fold (P < 0.01).6. Treatment of PC12 cells with 2 mumol/L 17-AAG for 30 min prior to NaHS pretreatment blocked the overexpression of Hsp90 induced by NaHS preconditioning, as evidenced by decreased cell viability (by 54.2 + 1.2%; P < 0.01), increased PC12 cell apoptosis (by 36.6 +/- 1.2%; P < 0.01) and increasing ROS production.7. The findings of the present study provide novel evidence that Hsp90 mediates H2S-induced neuroprotection against chemical hypoxia-induced injury via anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. © 2010 The Authors.

Here, we confirmed that treatment of rats with IMM-H004 immediately after TGCI/R ameliorated delayed neuronal death (DND) in the CA1 of hippocampus and cortex. Further study suggested that IMM-H004 contributed to the expression of antiapoptotic protein survivin through the activation of PI3K-dependent protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), which led to the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), then relieved the inhibiting effect on survivin promoter. Additionally, IMM-H004 also enhanced the expression of hepatitis B X-interacting protein (HBXIP), which formed a complex with survivin to prevent the activation of caspase death cascade, thereby halting apoptotic cell death. Finally, we injected a HBXIP siRNA into hippocampus and performed microelectroporation before ischemia/reperfusion, which abolished the protective effect of IMM-H004. Further study revealed that HBXIP maintained the high expression of Akt and survivin. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that DND after TGCI/R was alleviated by IMM-H004 through promoting the formation of survivin-HBXIP complex, which further emphasized the importance of endogenous protein involved in self-repair after stroke.

Sigma ligands caused loss of processes, assumption of spherical shape, and cessation of cell division. The time course and magnitude of this effect were dependent on the concentration of sigma ligand. Continued exposure to sigma compounds ultimately resulted in cell death. However, the morphological effect was reversible when sigma ligand was removed shortly after rounding. The potency of compounds to produce these effects generally correlated with binding affinity at sigma receptors of C6 glioma cell membranes labeled with [3H](+)-pentazocine. At a concentration of 100 muM, haloperidol, reduced haloperidol, fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, BD737, LR172, BD1008, and SH344 produced significant effects in 3-6 hr of exposure. Other compounds, such as trifluperidol, thioridazine, and (-)-butaclamol, produced significant effects by 24 hr of exposure. Despite the requirement of micromolar concentrations of ligand (some compounds were effective at 30 muM), the effect showed a remarkable specificity for compounds exhibiting sigma receptor binding affinity. Neuroleptics lacking potent sigma affinity [e.g., (-)-sulpiride, (+)- butaclamol, and clozapine] and other compounds that lack significant sigma affinity but that are agonists or antagonists at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic, glutamate, phencyclidine, GABA, opiate, or muscarinic cholinergic receptors were without effect on cellular morphology at concentrations up to 300 muM over a period of 72 hr. Likewise, blockers and activators of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor devoid of sigma affinity were without effect. Interestingly, 1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine (DTG), (+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine [(+)-3-PPP], (+)-pentazocine, (+)-cyclazocine, and other sigma-active benzomorphans and morphinans appeared inactive in up to 72 hr of culture. However, these compounds interacted synergistically with a subeffective dose of BD737 (30 muM) to produce effects usually in 6 hr or less. Also, the pH of the culture medium had a profound effect on the activity of sigma compounds. Increasing the pH from the normal range of 7.2-7.4 to pH 8.3-8.5 shifted the dose curves (30, 100, 300 muM) for all sigma compounds to the left. Under these conditions, DTG, (+)-3-PPP, and benzomorphans produced effects in 24 hr or less. Decreasing the medium pH to 6.5-6.7 markedly reduced the activity of all sigma ligands, producing significant protection from cytotoxic effects. Importantly, compounds that lacked sigma binding affinity showed neither synergism with 30 muM BD737 nor an increase in activity at higher pH. These results confirm the sigma receptor specificity of this effect. Sigma ligands had similar effects on other cells of neuronal and non-neuronal origin, including SK-N-SH and SH- SY5Y neuroblastomas, NCB-20 hybridoma, NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid, COS-7 (kidney), MRS-5 (lung), and PC12 pheochromocytoma.

Herein, the understandings of the sildenafil neuroprotective effect through increase of cGMP level and the mediation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation pathways on neurotoxicity induced by high glucose (HG) in PC12 cells as an in vitro cellular model for DN were investigated. Methods We reported that the PC12 cells pre-treatment with sildenafil (0.008 muM) for 60 min and then exposing the cells to HG (25 mM for 72 h) or normal glucose (NG) (5 mM for 72 h) condition, show: Results (1) significant attenuation in reactive oxygen species, MDA and TNF-a levels, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, expression of caspase 3 and UCP2 proteins; (2) significant increase in viability, GSH/GSSG ratio, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP levels. Conclusion All these data together led us to propose neuroprotective effect of sildenafil is probably through its antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Of course, further studies are required to explain the underlying mechanism of the sildenafil effects.

A cell viability assay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to identify active small molecules in XingNaoJing, which is a well known Chinese Medicine prescribed for the effective treatment of stroke. Studies have found that muscone is the active compound that prevents PC12 cell and cortical neuron damage following various injuries. Analysis of apoptosis indicated that muscone inhibited glutamate-induced apoptotic cell death of PC12 cells and cortical neurons. Fas and caspase-8 expression were upregulated following glutamate treatment in cortical neurons, and was markedly attenuated in the presence of muscone. Furthermore, muscone significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume, neurological dysfunction and inhibited cortical neuron apoptosis in middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO) rats in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, a significant decrease in Fas and caspase-8 expression in the rat cortex was observed in MCAO rats treated with muscone. Our results demonstrate that muscone may be a small active molecule with neuroprotective properties, and that inhibition of apoptosis and Fas is an important mechanism of neuroprotection by muscone. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for muscone in the treatment of stroke.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

This intervention is however still controversial. In this paper, we tested the bcl-2 or bcl-XL anti-apoptotic gene transfers using an adenovirus vector in PC12 cells after hypoxia and re-oxygenation. Gene delivery results in a significant increase in both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins expression. Hypoxia (1h)/re-oxygenation (4-48 h) have a detrimental effect upon cultured cells by inducing increased apoptosis by 30% compared to the controls. After hypoxia the compromised mitochondrial membrane function was detected by decreased tetramethyl-rhodamine-ethylester (TMRE) staining. Anti-apoptotic genes transferred 1h after hypoxia, prevent the cell damage; the number of apoptotic cells has been reduced significantly and the gene transfers prevent mitochondrial membrane damage. Under normoxic conditions or following hypoxia the expression of plasticity protein, growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43) increased significantly by the gene treatment. We can conclude that anti-apoptotic gene transfers are not only cytoprotective as it is already documented before but these genes activate GAP-43 as well.

In cultured human osteosarcoma cells, RA enhances the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7), a trophic factor that reduces ischemia- or neurotoxin-mediated neurodegeneration in vivo. The purpose of this study is to examine whether RA reduces ischemic brain injury through a BMP7 mechanism. We found that intracerebroventricular administration of 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) enhanced BMP7 mRNA expression, detected by RT-PCR, in rat cerebral cortex at 24 hr after injection. Rats were also subjected to transient focal ischemia induced by ligation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at 1 day after 9cRA injection. Pretreatment with 9cRA increased locomotor activity and attenuated neurological deficits 2 days after MCA ligatiom 9cRA also reduced cerebral infarction and TUNEL labeling. These protective responses were antagonized by the BMP antagonist noggin given 1 day after 9cRA injection. Taken together, our data suggest that 9cRA has protective effects against ischemia-induced injury, and these effects involve BMPs. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",1,3,"Excluded"
"e0a1f46d-4104-4cec-b565-65445e62f539","Stress-induced tRNA cleavage and tiRNA generation in rat neuronal PC12 cells","Transfer RNA (tRNA) plays a role in stress response programs involved in various pathological conditions including neurological diseases. Under cell stress conditions, intracellular tRNA is cleaved by a specific ribonuclease, angiogenin, generating tRNA-derived fragments or tRNA-derived stress-induced RNA (tiRNA). Generated tiRNA contributes to the cell stress response and has potential cell protective effects. However, tiRNA generation under stress conditions in neuronal cells has not been fully elucidated. To examine angiogenin-mediated tiRNA generation in neuronal cells, we used the rat neuronal cell line, PC12, in combination with analysis of SYBR staining and immuno-northern blotting using anti-1-methyladenosine antibody, which specifically and sensitively detects tiRNA. Oxidative stress induced by arsenite and hydrogen peroxide caused tRNA cleavage and tiRNA generation in PC12 cells. We also demonstrated that oxygen-glucose deprivation, which is an in vitro model of ischemic-reperfusion injury, induced tRNA cleavage and tiRNA generation. In these stress conditions, the amount of generated tiRNA was associated with the degree of morphological cell damage. Time course analysis indicated that generation of tiRNA was prior to severe cell damage and cell death. Angiogenin over-expression did not influence the amount of tiRNA in normal culture conditions; however, it significantly increased tiRNA generation induced by cell stress conditions. Our findings show that angiogenin-mediated tiRNA generation can be induced in neuronal cells by different cell stressors, including ischemia-reperfusion. Additionally, detection of tiRNA could be used as a potential cell damage marker in neuronal cells. (Figure presented.). Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14191.

It was recently shown to induce production of the neurotrophic factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and to rescue neuronal-like PC-12 cells from neurotrophic factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that AS101 improves functional outcome and reduces brain damage in a mouse model of focal ischemic stroke. Both pre-stroke and post-stroke intraperitoneal treatments with AS101 reduced infarct size and edema and improved the neurological function of the animals. AS101 treatments reduced both apoptotic and inflammatory caspase activities, and also inhibited protein tyrosine nitration suggesting that AS101 suppresses oxidative stress. Studies of cultured neurons showed that AS101 confers protection against apoptosis induced by either glucose deprivation or the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal. Moreover, AS101 treatment reduced glutamate-induced intracellular calcium elevation, a major contributor to neuronal death in stroke. As AS101 has an excellent safety profile in humans, our pre-clinical data suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of AS101 in patients suffering from stroke and other neurodegenerative conditions. © 2007 International Society for Neurochemistry.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,6,"Excluded"

Glutamate, a major excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a critical role during stroke/cerebral ischemia. In this study, we explored the protective effects of NsTyr on glutamate neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and investigated its underlying mechanisms. NsTyr treatment attenuated glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in a dose-dependent manner and the best performance was observed at 10 muM. NsTyr treatment suppressed glutamate-induced upregulation of lipoxygenase 12/15 (LOX 12/15) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, attenuated the increase of BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid) in the mitochondria, prevented the loss of mitochondria membrane potential and consequently inhibited apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation into the nucleus. The results demonstrated that NsTyr could protect cells against AIF-mediated caspase-independent cell death induced by glutamate, which may be due to the blockage of Bid-mediated mitochondrial damage via reducing LOX 12/15 activity and ROS accumulation. © 2014 The Japanese Pharmacological Society.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,3,"Excluded"

Oxidative stress is critical for pathophysiology of secondary damage, thus we mainly focused on the anti-oxidant effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) on PC-12 and SH-SY5Y cells as well as the underlying mechanisms. Method(s): Oxidative stress was induced by H2O2 stimulation. Effects of LBPs on cell viability, apoptosis, and expression of proteins associated with apoptosis and autophagy in H2O2-induced cells were assessed by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. Then, expression of miR-194 was determined by qRT-PCR. Expression of miR-194 was dysregulated, and whether LBPs affected H2O2-treated cells through modulating miR-194 was verified. The expression of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT pathway and the intracellular levels of ROS and NO were testified by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry with fluorescent probes. Result(s): H2O2-induced decrease of cell viability and increases of apoptosis and autophagy in PC-12 cells were mitigated by LBPs treatment. Next, we found that miR-194 expression was both down-regulated by LBPs treatment in PC-12 and SH-SY5Y cells. More experiments consolidated that influence of LBPs on H2O2-treated cells was reversed by miR-194 overexpression while was augmented by miR-194 inhibition. LBPs elevated the phosphorylated levels of PI3K and AKT and reduced levels of ROS and NO through miR-194. Conclusion(s): LBPs alleviated H2O2-induced decrease of cell viability, and increase of apoptosis and autophagy through down-regulating miR-194. Moreover, LBPs activated the PI3K/AKT pathway and reduced oxidative stress through miR-194.

However, the molecular mechanisms of DDT for protecting neurons from oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis after ICH still remains elusive. In this study, high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint analysis was performed to learn the features of the chemical compositions of DDT. OGD-induced ER stress, Ca(2+) overload, and mitochondrial apoptosis were investigated in nerve growth factor -induced PC12, primary neuronal cells, and ICH rats to evaluate the protective effect of DDT. We found that DDT treatment protected neurons against OGD-induced damage and apoptosis by increasing cell viability and reducing the release of lactate dehydrogenase. DDT decreased OGD-induced Ca(2+) overload and ER stress through the blockade of the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)- inositol-requiring protein 1alpha (IRE1)/ protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways and also inhibited apoptosis by decreasing mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we observed similar findings when we studied DDT for inhibition of ER stress in a rat model of ICH. In addition, our experiments further confirmed the neuroprotective potential of DDT against tunicamycin (TM)-induced neural damage. Our in vitro and in vivo results indicated that the neuroprotective effect of DDT against ER stress damage and apoptosis occurred mainly by blocking the GPR78-IRE1/PERK pathways.

Previous studies have demonstrated that RA has protective effects against damage caused by H2O2 or oxygen-glucose deprivation in mesangial and PC12 cells. Pretreatment with 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA) reduced infarction and TUNEL labeling in cerebral cortex as well as attenuated neurological deficits after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. The purpose of this study was to examine a protective role of 9cRA in dopaminergic (DA) neurons in a typical rodent model of Parkinsons disease (PD). RESULTS: The protective role of 9cRA was first examined in rat primary ventromesencephalic culture. Treatment with 9cRA significantly reduced 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-mediated cell death and TUNEL labeling in cultured dopaminergic neurons. The protective effect was also examined in adult male rats. Animals received unilateral 6-OHDA lesioning at the left medial forebrain bundle on day 0. Methamphetamine -induced rotational behavior was examined on days 6, 20 and 30 after lesioning. Animals were separated into 2 groups to balance rotational behavior and lesion extent on day 6 and were treated with either 9cRA or vehicle (i.c.v. on day 7 + intra-nasal from day 8 to day 14). Post-treatment with 9cRA significantly reduced methamphetamine -mediated ipislateral rotation at 20 and 30 days after lesioning. In vivo voltammetry was used to examine DA overflow in striatum. Treatment with 9cRA significantly increased KCl -evoked DA release in the lesioned striatum. 9cRA also increased tyrosine hydroxylase (+) cell number in the lesioned nigra as determined by unbiased stereology.

The mechanisms underlying estrogen neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that autophagy plays a crucial role in the course of nerve injury. In this study, we showed that E2 treatment improved the restoration of locomotor function and decreased the loss of motor neurons in SCI rats. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis revealed that the protective function of E2 was related to the suppression of LC3II and beclin-1 expression. Immunohistochemical study further confirmed that the immunoreactivity of LC3 in the motor neurons was down-regulated when treated with E2. In vitro studies demonstrated similar results that E2 pretreatment decreased the autophagic activity induced by rapamycin (autophagy sensitizer) and increased viability in a PC12 cell model.

Anesthetics, such as isoflurane, sevoflurane, ketamine, and desflurane, are commonly used in clinics. Specifically, isoflurane is one of the most commonly used inhalational anesthetics, which can be used in surgery patients of all ages, including children. Objectives. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms of vitexin against isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. Material and methods. Reference memory testing was performed for 5 days (4 trials, 2 per day) before anesthesia. Reversal testing was performed on the 3rd day after anesthesia. The cell viability and apoptosis of PC-12 cells were detected using MTT and TUNEL assays, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were used to measure serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentrations. The concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using ROS measurement. Expression of miR-409 was determined using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPT-PCR). Protein expression levels were detected using western blotting. Results. Rats treated with isoflurane showed significant increases in the escape latency periods (ELP) and the apoptosis of hippocampus neuron cells; this effect was reversed by 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of vitexin (p < 0.05). Further testing showed that isoflurane could significantly decrease the cell viability and increase the apoptosis of PC-12, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and ROS (p < 0.05). However, these results were reversed by 10/100 muM of vitexin. In addition, vitexin could significantly increase the expression of miR-409 (p < 0.05). Further studies showed that overexpression of miR-409 could significantly promote the effect of vitexin on isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity (p < 0.05). Finally, overexpression miR-409 could significantly increase the expression of p-AMPK/t-AMPK and p-GSK3beta/t-GSK3beta. Conclusions.

The familial-PD-related protein DJ-1 was reported to reduce dopaminergic degeneration triggered by -syn or by the dopaminergic-selective neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Objective: The aim was to further investigate the role of DJ-1 in dopaminergic degeneration and to see whether a cell-permeable recombinant form of DJ-1 (TAT-DJ-1) could restore dopamine depletion in vivo, thus representing an innovative therapeutic approach. Methods: We developed in vitro (PC12/TetOn cells and mouse primary mesencephalic neurons) and in vivo models [including DJ-1 knockout (-/-) mice] to investigate DJ-1 in dopaminergic degeneration. Results: We found that in PC12/TetOn cells overexpressing -syn with the familial-PD linked mutation A30P, DJ-1 silencing increased -syn (A30P) toxicity. Primary mesencephalic neurons from DJ-1 (-/-) mice were more vulnerable to a cell-permeable form of -syn (TAT-syn) and to 6-OHDA. Intrastriatally administered TAT-DJ-1 reduced 6-OHDA toxicity in vivo in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, when we injected TAT-syn (A30P) in the striatum of DJ-1 (-/-) animals, dopamine was depleted more than in the control strain.

Currently, however, there are few drugs treating brain diseases in the clinic by enhancing neurite outgrowth. In this study, we established an NGF-induced PC12 differentiation model to screen novel compounds that have the potential to induce neuronal differentiation, and further characterized 4,10-Aromadendranediol (ARDD) isolated from the dried twigs of the Baccharis gaudichaudiana plant, which exhibited the capability of promoting neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells in vitro. ARDD (1, 10 mumol/L) significantly enhanced neurite outgrowth in NGF-treated PC12 cells and N1E115 cells in a time-dependent manner. In cultured primary cortical neurons, ARDD (5, 10 mumol/L) not only significantly increased neurite outgrowth but also increased the number of neurites on the soma and the number of bifurcations. Further analyses showed that ARDD (10 mumol/L) significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the downstream GSK-3beta, subsequently induced beta-catenin expression and up-regulated the gene expression of the Wnt ligands Fzd1 and Wnt3a in neuronal cells. The neurite outgrowth-promoting effect of ARDD in neuronal cells was abolished by pretreatment with the specific ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, but was partially reversed by XAV939, an inhibitor of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. ARDD also increased the expression of BDNF, CREB and GAP-43 in N1E115 cells, which was reversed by pretreatment with PD98059. In N1E115 cells subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), pretreatment with ARDD (1-10 mumol/L) significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and induced neurite outgrowth.

Here,we identified Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1), an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing 6 (TMBIM6) gene, as a novelmodulator of ER-stress-induced apoptosis after HI brain injury in a neonatal rat pup. The main objective of our study was to overexpress BI-1, via viral-mediated gene delivery of human adenoviral-TMBIM6 (Ad-TMBIM6) vector, to investigate its anti-apoptotic effects as well as to elucidate its signaling pathways in an in vivo neonatal HI rat model and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)model. Ten-day-old unsexed Sprague Dawley rat pups underwent right common carotid artery ligation followed by 1.5 h of hypoxia. Rat pups injected with Ad-TMBIM6 vector, 48 h pre-HI, showed a reduction in relative infarcted area size, attenuated neuronal degeneration and improved long-term neurological outcomes. Furthermore, silencing of BI-1 or further activating the IRE1a branch of the UPR, using a CRISPR activation plasmid, was shown to reverse the protective effects of BI-1. Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, the protective effects of BI-1 are mediated via inhibition of IRE1a signaling and in part via inhibition of the second stress sensor receptor, PERK.

The objectives of this study were to investigate whether there might be miRNAs in the brain able to regulate NCX1 expression and, thereafter, to set up a valid therapeutic strategy able to reduce stroke-induced brain damage by regulating NCX1 expression. Thus, we tested whether miR-103-1, a microRNA belonging to the miR-103/107 family that on the basis of sequence analysis might be a potential NCX1 regulator, could control NCX1 expression. The role of miR-103-1 was assessed in a rat model of transient cerebral ischemia by evaluating the effect of the correspondent antimiRNA on both brain infarct volume and neurological deficits. NCX1 expression was dramatically reduced when cortical neurons were exposed to miR-103-1. This alleged tight regulation of NCX1 by miR-103-1 was further corroborated by luciferase assay. Notably, antimiR-103-1 prevented NCX1 protein downregulation induced by the increase in miR-103-1 after brain ischemia, thereby reducing brain damage and neurological deficits. Overall, the identification of a microRNA able to selectively regulate NCX1 in the brain clarifies a new important molecular mechanism of NCX1 regulation in the brain and offers the opportunity to develop a new therapeutic strategy for stroke.

Using an unbiased proteomic search, we identified ALDH2 deficiency in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) as compared with spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We concluded the causative role of ALDH2 deficiency in neuronal injury as overexpression or activation of ALDH2 conferred neuroprotection by clearing 4-HNE in in vitro studies. Further, ALDH2-knockdown rats revealed the absence of neuroprotective effects of PKCepsilon. Moderate ethanol administration that is known to exert protection against stroke was shown to enhance the detoxification of 4-HNE, and to protect against ischemic cerebral injury through the PKCepsilon-ALDH2 pathway. In SHR-SP, serum 4-HNE level was persistently elevated and correlated inversely with the lifespan. The role of 4-HNE in stroke in humans was also suggested by persistent elevation of its plasma levels for at least 6 months after stroke. Lastly, we observed that 21 of 1 242 subjects followed for 8 years who developed stroke had higher initial plasma 4-HNE levels than those who did not develop stroke. These findings suggest that activation of the ALDH2 pathway may serve as a useful index in the identification of stroke-prone subjects, and the ALDH2 pathway may be a potential target of therapeutic intervention in stroke. © 2013 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,19,"Excluded"

Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h followed by a 24-h reoxygenation. GSRd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection when presented during OGD and reoxygenation, which may be ascribed to its antioxidative properties by reducing the intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde production; increasing glutathione content; and enhancing the antioxidant enzymatic activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Additionally, GSRd could stabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuate apoptotic death of hippocampal neurons after OGD exposure.

The present results showed that, at low concentrations, pretreatment with BME triggered stress response by causing ROS production, then, activated survival-promoting signals via ERK and Akt activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, resulting in decrease in cytotoxicity induced by the OGD. It may be accepted that mild pretreatment with BME stimulated transient and moderate ROS production, but activated hormetic signals and induced stress responsive genes. In contrast, high concentrations of BME displayed toxic action due to massive ROS production. These results suggested that the effect of BME on the OGD-induced PC12 cells may be hormetic mechanism including induction of oxidative stress and subsequent activation of stress response gene expression.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Included",5,50,"Included"

We find that in rat cerebellar granule neurones, the antagonist basilen blue prevents neuronal death under hypoglycaemia. Basilen blue acts through a wide temporal range and it retains its efficacy under chemically induced hypoxic conditions, in the presence of the respiratory inhibitors of mitochondria electron transport chain complexes II (3-nitropropionic acid) and III (antimycin A). In spite of the presence of these compounds, basilen blue maintains normal intracellular ATP levels. It furthermore prevents neuronal death caused by agents blocking the mitochondrial calcium uptake (ruthenium red) or discharging the mitochondrial membrane potential (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone). Inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, modulation of the enzyme GAPDH and mitochondrial transport of mono-carboxylic acids are not conceivable targets for the action of basilen blue. Survival is sustained by basilen blue also in CNS primary cultures from hippocampus and in PNS sympathetic-like neurones. Partial neuroprotection is furthermore provided by three additional P2 receptor antagonists: suramin, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2,4-disulphonic acid 4-sodium and 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2disulphonic acid. Our data suggest the exploitation of selected P2 receptor antagonists as potential neuroprotective agents.

Protective potential of steroidal hormone (17beta-estradiol) has also been suggested. However, therapeutic potential of such promising hormone is hampered due to complex brain anatomy and physiology. Thus, the present investigations were studied to suggest the applicability of dopamine expressing PC12 cells as in vitro tool to screen the pharmacological potential of 17beta-estradiol against 4-HNE and 6-OHDA. MTT assay was conducted for cytotoxicity assessment of both 4-HNE (1 muM to 50 muM) and 6-OHDA (10-4 to 10-7 M). Non-cytotoxic concentrations, that is, 4-HNE (1 muM) and 6-OHDA (10-6 M) were selected to study the synergetic/additive responses. PC12 cells were found to be more vulnerable towards co-exposure of individual exposure of 4-HNE and 6-OHDA, even at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Then, cells were subjected to pre-treatment (24 hours) of 17beta-estradiol (1 muM), followed by a permutation of combinations of both 4-HNE and 6-OHDA. Pretreatment of 17beta-estradiol was found to be significantly effective against the cytotoxic responses of 4-HNE and 6-OHDA, when the damage was at lower level. However, 17beta-estradiol was found to be ineffective against higher concentrations. Physiological-specific responses of PC12 cells against 4-HNE/6-OHDA and 17beta-estradiol suggest its applicability as first tier of screening tool. © The Author(s) 2010.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

METHODS: The ASCI rat model was established, and expression of miR-411 and Fas ligand (FasL) was examined. Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score was used to evaluate the rats neurological function. PC12 oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model was also established. Gene manipulation (including miR-411 mimic or inhibitor) was used to modulate gene expression. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the targeting relationship between miR-411 and FasL. Flow cytometry was applied in the measurement of PC12cell apoptosis. Finally, the miR-411 mimic was injected into the vertebral canal of ASCI rats to determine the effects of miR-411 in vivo. RESULTS: Compared with sham group, the expression of miR-411 and FasL was significantly decreased and increased in ASCI group, respectively (P<0.05). Similarly, the expression of miR-411 and FasL was significantly lower and higher in OGD group than that in control group, respectively (P<0.05). miR-411 directly controlled the FasL expression. miR-411 mimic can dramatically reduce the increased percentage of apoptosis cells caused by OGD when comparing to mimic control, which was greatly reversed by the overexpression of FasL (P<0.05). Further, the BBB score was significantly elevated in the miR-411 mimic group when comparing to mimic control group, with decreased FasL expression (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: miR-411 mimic suppressed PC12cell apoptosis via FasL, and relieved ASCI in rats.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Included","Excluded",4,28,"Excluded"

Growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) is widely reported as a tumor suppressor gene; however, the investigations about its role in cerebrovascular disease are relatively rare. This study was aimed to explore the impact of GAS5 on hypoxia response in nervous cells. PC-12 cells were incubated under anoxic condition to induce hypoxia injury. Regulatory effects of GAS5 on miR-124 and miR-124 on ICAM-1 expression were assessed by qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. Targeting effect of miR-124 on ICAM-1 3-untranslated regions (UTR) was evaluated through dual luciferase activity assay. The potential regulatory mechanism on hypoxia injury in PC-12 cells was assessed by detecting key elements of NF-kappaB and Notch signaling pathways using Western blot. GAS5 ectopic expression accentuated hypoxia injury in PC-12 cells. miR-124 expression was negatively regulated by GAS5 expression. Cells with overexpressions of GAS5 and miR-124 alleviated hypoxia injury as in compassion with cells only with GAS5 overexpression. ICAM-1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-124 expression. ICAM-1 was a functional target of miR-124. ICAM-1 overexpression aggravated hypoxia injury, but inversely, ICAM-1 silence diminished hypoxia damage. Besides, ICAM-1 expression was negatively related with activation of NF-kappaB and Notch pathways. GAS5-miR-124-ICAM-1 axis could regulate hypoxia injury in PC-12 cells. GAS5 might aggravate hypoxia injury via down-regulating miR-124, then up-regulating ICAM-1, and further enhancing activations of NF-kappaB and Notch pathways.

Previous studies have indicated that danshensu (beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-lactic acid), a main hydrophilic component of the Chinese materia medica Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (Danshen, Pharmacopoeia of PR China), has ROS scavenging and antioxidant activities, however its mechanism of action was not clear. In this study, we investigated whether the protective effects of danshensu against neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced oxidative stress involved the Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. Pretreatment with danshensu in PC12 cells significantly attenuated 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity and the production of ROS. Danshensu activated the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 to increase heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), conferring protection against ROS. Danshensu induced the phosphorylation of Akt, and its cytoprotective effect was abolished by PI3K, Akt and HO-1 inhibitors. These results confirmed the crucial role of PI3K/Akt and HO-1 signaling pathways as the underlying mechanistic action of danshensu. Taken together, the results suggest that danshensu enhances HO-1 expression to suppress 6-OHDA-induced oxidative damage via PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathways. Moreover, 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss in zebrafish could be reduced by danshensu, further supporting the neuroprotective potential of danshensu. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","No","Yes","OK: File is read Successfully","Excluded","Excluded",0,1,"Excluded"

Herein, we tested the influences of propofol, a commonly used intravenous sedative hypnotic drug, on apoptosis and autophagy aroused by hypoxia stimulation in PC-12 and HT-22 cells. Method(s): Followed by hypoxia and/or propofol treatment, cell viability of PC-12 and HT-22 cells, apoptosis and autophagy, along with microRNA-137 (miR-137) expression were measured, respectively. Then, miR-137 inhibitor was transfected to silence miR-137. Whether miR-137 took part in the impacts of propofol on hypoxia-exposed cells was explored. Finally, the activities of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways were measured. Result(s): Hypoxia stimulation aroused cell apoptosis and elevated cell autophagy in PC-12 and HT-22 cells. Propofol weakened the apoptosis and autophagy of PC-12 and HT-22 cells aroused by hypoxia. Moreover, propofol elevated the miR-137 level in PC-12 and HT-22 cells. Silencing miR-137 declined the influences of propofol on hypoxia-induced injuries. Besides, propofol promoted PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways activation in hypoxia-exposed cells through raising miR-137.

However, NO liberated in excessive amounts can be involved in macromolecular and mitochondrial damage in brain aging and in neurodegenerative disorders. The molecular mechanism of its neurotoxic action is not fully understood. Our previous data indicated involvement of NO in the release of arachidonic acid (AA), a substrate for cyclo- and lipoxygenases (COX and LOX, respectively). In this study we investigated biochemical processes leading to cell death evoked by an NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). We found that SNP decreased viability of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. SNP at 0.1 mM caused a significant increase of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) protein level in mitochondria. Under these conditions 80% of PC12 cells survived. The enhancement of mitochondrial AIF level might protect most of PC12 cells against death. However, NO released from 0.5 mM SNP induced massive cell death but had no effect on protein level and localization of AIF and cytochrome c. Caspase-3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) protein levels were not changed. However, PARP activity significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner. Inhibition of both COX isoforms and of 12/15-LOX significantly lowered the SNP-evoked cell death. We conclude that AIF, cytochrome c and caspase-3 are not responsible for the NO-mediated cell death evoked by SNP. The data demonstrate that NO liberated in excess decreases PARP-1 activity.

The roles of miR-210 in rat adrenal gland pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells remain unknown. We aimed to explore the possible effect of miR-210 in neonatal brain injury. We explored the potential molecular mechanism by using PC-12 cells under hypoxia. Scramble miRs, miR-210 mimic, miR-210 inhibitor or its negative control were respectively transfected into PC-12 cells. Cell viability, migration, invasion and apoptosis were also assessed to evaluate hypoxia-induced cell injury. The expression level of miR-210 was identified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Apoptosis related protein expression as well as key kinases in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal pathway was studied by Western blot analysis. Hypoxia suppressed cell viability, migration and invasion, but promoted apoptosis through activation of mitochondrial- and caspase-dependent pathways. Hypoxia markedly induced up-regulation of miR-210 in PC-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-210 protected PC-12 cells against hypoxia-induced injury. Bcl-2 adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) was proven to be a target gene of miR-210 in PC-12 cells. miR-210 overexpression ameliorated the hypoxia-induced injury in PC-12 cells by down-regulating BNIP3. Hypoxia-induced alterations of key kinases in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway were affected by aberrant expression of BNIP3.

Glutamate receptor overactivation is also involved in ischemic- and seizure-induced neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. However, little is known at the single cell-level how NF-kappaB signaling relates to neuronal survival during excitotoxic injury. We found that silencing of p65/NF-kappaB delayed N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic injury in hippocampal neurons, suggesting a functional role of p65 in excitotoxicity. Time-lapse imaging of p65 and its inhibitor IkappaBalpha using GFP and Cerulean fusion proteins revealed specific patterns of excitotoxic NF-kappaB activation. Nuclear translocation of p65 began on average 8+/-3min following 15min of NMDA treatment and was observed in up to two thirds of hippocampal neurons. Nuclear translocation of IkappaBalpha preceded that of p65 suggesting independent translocation processes. In surviving neurons, the onset of p65 nuclear export correlated with mitochondrial membrane potential recovery.

Recently, we have demonstrated that Xyloketal B can directly scavenge DPPH free radicals and protects mitochondria against oxidative insult. In the present study, we investigate the neuroprotective action of xyloketal B against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans and PC12 cells. The viability and DA neurodegeneration was assessed in C. elegans selectively expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in DA neurons. PC12 cell damage was measured using MTT and nuclear morphology. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential and total GSH were assessed. Xyloketal B dose-dependently protected against MPP+-induced loss of viability and DA neurodegeneration in C. elegans. Similar neuroprotection was replicated in MPP+ PC12 cell model. In addition, xyloketal B attenuated MPP+-induced intracellular ROS accumulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and restored total GSH level in PC12 cells.

Since inflammatory factors play an important role in hypoxic injury, we sought to determine if DOR modulates cellular inflammatory process in hypoxia. Since astrocytes produce inflammatory cytokines and play a major role in inflammatory response to hypoxia, we exposed cultured rat astrocytes to severe hypoxia (0.1% O2) for 3-6 h to examine if DOR activation altered hypoxia-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) along with cell viability. To examine a differential DOR-mediated modulation between glial and neuron-like cells, we also conducted the same experiments in differentiated PC-12 cells. We found that hypoxia reduced cell viability in both astrocytes and PC-12 cells, and DOR activation with UFP-512 (5 muM) effectively protected both the cells against hypoxic insult. Hypoxia markedly increased TNF-alpha levels in the astrocytes (p < 0.05); however, the same hypoxic stress reduced TNF-alpha levels in the PC-12 cells. Exogenous addition of TNF-alpha to the culture media further worsened the hypoxia-induced damage in PC-12 cells. Hypoxia increased the DOR-expression in astrocytes but not in PC-12 cells. DOR-activation reversed the hypoxia-induced changes in TNF-alpha levels in both the cells. In contrast, the IL-1beta levels did not significantly alter in astrocytes and PC-12 cells when exposed to the same hypoxic conditions or following DOR activation.

The aim of this study was to clarify whether resveratrol can exert neuroprotective effects via activating neuronal autophagic flux, in view of the underlying role of the autophagic flux mediated by resveratrol on neuronal apoptosis after spinal cord injury, and identify the role of the liver kinase B1(LKB1)/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70s6k) signal pathway in the autophagic flux mediated by resveratrol. The results obtained strongly indicate that resveratrol improved functional recovery in Sprague-Dawley rats after acute spinal cord injury, preserved their motor neurons, alleviated the neuronal apoptosis, and ameliorated neuronal autophagic flux. After blocking the autophagic flux, the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol were eliminated. Furthermore, it was proved that resveratrol can activate the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR/p70s6k pathway in vivo and in vitro, and the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR/p70s6k pathway plays a vital role in activating the autophagic flux mediated by resveratrol in PC12 cells. Thus, resveratrol enables to ameliorate neuronal autophagic flux via the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR/p70s6k pathway to alleviate apoptosis, and finally ameliorating functional recovery after acute SCI in SD rats.
